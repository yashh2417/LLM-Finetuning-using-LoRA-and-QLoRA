FOREWORD
The Bhagavad Gita, in spite of being an episode in The Mahabharata,
has more to it. The Mahabharata, which is said to date back to 5000 B.C., is
still adored and read, not only for its being an epic of enormous proportions
but also because it is a tale reflecting the man of all times. If one feels that
it is a fictitious story, it has all that a masterpiece demands. If it is
considered something beyond and a real tale, it evidences the existence of
superior human beings. All the characters in the epic were highly learned
and were disciples of Guru Drona, according to the story. They were all
human beings, despite the fact that they had the personal interference of
God himself in their lives.
This story is an example of the weaknesses that human beings are
subject to. Arjuna’s doubts in the Bhagavad Gita are the doubts of every
man. Like when we are in the line of duty, we are often pulled by fears,
doubts, jealousies, weaknesses, nepotism, etc. Arjuna too was vexed of war
by his excessive love, respect, and devotion for his elders, relatives, and
friends whom he had to fight against.
Here, Arjuna says that he was ‘Nara’ in every respect. He was a bundle
of human weaknesses, despite being physically strong. Krishna’s sermon to
Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita was an attempt to uplift him from his mental
discrepancy. In other words, it is a great treatise on ‘personality
development’, a modern buzz word. All the planes of the human mind find
mention here. It seeks to address all the ills of man, be they physical,
psychological, spiritual, or whatever.
And Arjuna here appears to be a studious disciple, with his coming out
with a great many questions, which rather tickle every learned mind. The
occasion here was that the Bhagwan himself was the fount of the sermon.
Hence Arjuna, the archer that he was here for the moment, was aiming
arrows of questions, and those questions were turning out to be real sources
of light for all mankind, by the divine grace of Bhagwan Krishna. Arjuna,
in fact, had received instructions from Guru Drona and could never be in
need of an elaborate instruction. It was only a momentary delusion for

xjkhh

Arjuna, and Krishna arranged that pretext as the stage for giving him the
sermon of the ‘Bhagavad Gita’. Such human weaknesses are all we are
prone to. Hence, ‘Bhagavad Gita’ is for all of us.
Arjuna was sermonised by Lord Krishna in the middle of the battle. It
was one such occasion where sometimes even great and illumined souls
could turn ignorant and weak. The Bhagavad Gita’ was an attempt to alert
Arjuna to human acts on a big stage like the Kurukshetra battle. It was like
learning while doing or like a good lesson that we usually learn at the
height of misery and peril. No wonder that the Bhagavad Gita is a
prescribed text in India and elsewhere for students.
Several attempts have been made at various times to explain the spirit
of the Gita to man. This one attempt by Dr.Giridhar Boray is born out of
his intention to bring the ‘Bhagavad Gita’ to the attention of the present
day younger generation. It is strengthened in the light of its taking
inspiration from the Gita Vivruti by HH Sri Raghavendra Teertha and
lectures by HH Sri Vidya Sagara Madhava Teertha Swamiji, head of the Sri
Madhava Teertha Pontificate and Sree Sameerachar of Tambihalli Math.
The book makes understanding the concepts easier by providing a
summary of all the chapters at the beginning as well as at the end of each
verse. The book is really a diligent effort offered at the lotus feet of Lord
Sri Venkateswara in all humility. A complete study of the whole book
without deleting any subtitle is bound to bring to the common man the
required spiritual knowledge and also immense satisfaction.

In the Service of Lord Venkateswara

Guru Vandana – Obeisance to the Teacher
I offer my respectful obeisance to His Holiness Sri Vidyasagara
Madhava Teertha Swamiji, pontiff of Sri Madhava Teertha Pontificate in
Karnataka, India. His Holiness is the 25th pontiff in the lineage of Sri
Madhava Teertha, the 14th century ascetic and philosopher who was a direct
disciple of Sri Madhwacharya, the exponent of the Dvaita (theistic dualism)
school of Indian philosophy. Vishnu Shastri, a great scholar in the Advaita
(theistic monism) school of philosophy of the 13th century came in contact
with Sri Madhwacharya, who was reviving the theistic dualism philosophy
built on the fundamental premise of a clear difference between the
individual soul and the Lord Almighty (the Supreme Soul). Vishnu Shastri
was greatly influenced by the divine, scholarly arguments of Sri
Madhwacharya and in particular by his commentary on 40 selected hymns
of the Rig Veda. He became a disciple of Sri Madhwacharya and entered
the monastery as Sri Madhava Teertha. He headed the Madhwa Pontificate
in the 14th century. He is credited to be the only scholar to have composed a
rigorous commentary on all the four Vedas based on the concepts of the
Dvaita philosophy. He was blessed and gifted with the beautiful idol of
Lord Sri Veera Rama by Sri Madhwacharya, and this idol continues to be
worshipped to this day by the reigning pontiff.
The reigning pontiff HH Sri Vidyasagara Madhava Teertha was born
on the most auspicious Ananta Chaturdashi day of 1932 to very pious
parents, in the illustrious lineage of HH Sri Kambaluru Ramachandra
Teertha of the glorious Sri Vyasaraja Math. He was named Venkatesha. He
was groomed into every aspect of Sri Madhwa’s philosophy from his
childhood days by his father who was also a great scholar. He had a
brilliant academic record, securing a master’s degree in Literature followed
by a Doctorate in the Mahabharata from Karnataka University. He chose
teaching as his career and served as Professor and Principal of Government
Arts College in the state of Andhra Pradesh.

xiii

After retiring from active service, he was invited to be the Principal
of Sri Guru Sarvabhowma Samskruta Vidyapeeta at Mantralayam where he
served at the divine feet of Sri Raghavendra Swamy. Pleased by his service,
within a year, Sri Raghavendra Swamy chose him to lead the pontificate of
Sri Madhava Teertha Moola Samsthana math, resulting in an invitation to
him by the then pontiff Sri Prasanna Shoora Madhavateertha. He was
named Sri Vidyasagara Madhavateertha, and he has been serving the
pontificate for over 19 years performing daily worship to the most sacred
Sri Veera Rama idol with great devotion and dedication. An erudite scholar
with proficiency in many aspects of literature, arts, and mastery over many
languages, HH has composed many devotional songs in Kannada which
bring out his emotional relationship with the Lord Almighty. HH observes
strict austerities for ascetics as laid down by Sri Madhwacharya and is an
ideal seer in every sense. Under his stewardship the pontificate has made
great strides and attracted many loyal, committed followers.
Due to divine providence, I got the opportunity to attend the daily
lectures conducted by His Holiness on Gita Vivruti - a commentary on the
Bhagavad Gita by the 16th century ascetic and philosopher Sri
Raghavendra Teertha, which is based on the commentary by Sri
Madhwacharya and Sri Jaya Teertha. HH graciously supported and blessed
my effort (a feeble though!) to capture in English, the essence of Sri
Raghavendra Teertha’s Gita Vivruti and his lectures which were in
Kannada, to benefit a larger audience. I respectfully offer this work to His
Holiness as Guru Dakshina and seek his blessings.

Introduction - Background and Battleground
Over centuries, the Bhagavad Gita has been considered an
important spiritual guidebook and has influenced many thought leaders in
human history. The Gita is a conversational poem and is part of the great
Indian epic the Mahabharata, which is a story about the families of two
brothers who inherit a kingdom from their father. These cousins are known
as the ‘Pandavas’ and the ‘Kauravas’. The Kaurava brothers are 100 in
number and the Pandavas are 5. The Kauravas, not wanting to share the
kingdom with their cousins, invite them to a game of dice. They use
dubious means to defeat the Pandavas and annex their kingdom after
winning the wager. As per the rules of the wager, the Pandavas complete
their stay outside the kingdom and come back to ask for their fair share of
the kingdom so that they can rule with dignity. The Kauravas refuse to
honor the agreement and even deny the Pandavas a settlement of 5 villages
so that they can live in peace. As the Kauravas refuse to budge even an
inch, the Pandavas have no choice but to declare war on them to get back
their share of the kingdom. During this period, The Lord who has
incarnated as Krishna offers the cousins a choice between His army and
Himself. But He makes it clear that He Himself would not be participating
in the war. The Kauravas choose His army as Krishna would not be
fighting, and the Pandavas are happy to just have Krishna on their side.
Krishna takes on the role of charioteer to Arjuna’s chariot (Arjuna is the
third brother among the five Pandavas).
Before the war starts, the two armies assemble on the battlefield,
facing each other. At this point, Arjuna requests Krishna to place his
chariot in the middle so that he can get a full view of the warring forces.
Since this is a war between cousins, Arjuna sees his cousins, uncles,
grandfathers, great grandfathers, nephews, friends, classmates etc. on both
sides. He is overcome with emotion and grief at the prospect of bloodshed
among his family and friends for the sake of a kingdom. He declares his
intention to renounce the war and let the Kauravas keep the kingdom, thus

2

The Bhagavad Gita

abdicating his responsibility as a prince and a warrior. It is at this stage that
Krishna teaches him the Gita which is structured as a series of questions
from Arjuna and answers from Krishna. Krishna extols the virtue of
performing one’s duties regardless of the outcome, and not avoiding
prescribed duties which may be difficult and unpleasant. As Krishna starts
to talk to Arjuna on the virtues of doing one’s work (in this case Arjuna
needing to fight a rightful war), Arjuna asks a series of questions on the
bigger issues of life, individual souls, the Lord Almighty, the universe, the
circle of life etc., for which Krishna provides clear, unambiguous answers.
He finally convinces Arjuna that his fears were unfounded and that he
should fight to free the Kingdom from the Kauravas and provide a just and
compassionate administration to his citizens.
At first a battleground is hardly the place for someone to be
preaching philosophy. However, many of the questions that we have in life
are about the choices we have to make, especially in challenging times. It is
interesting to note that Sanskrit verses lend themselves to multiple
meanings and in one interpretation, the battleground in the Gita is
compared to the human body (and mind), and the battle between the
Pandavas and the Kauravas is compared to the constant strife between good
and evil thoughts that we encounter daily. The Gita is indeed a teaching for
all of us, with Arjuna acting as an example of an individual at crossroads,
desperately looking for guidance and support.
The Gita is one of the most widely read and commented upon
spiritual works in human history. There are several excellent books on it in
various languages. Given that the original work is in Sanskrit, most of the
scholarly commentaries have been in Sanskrit or other Indian languages
which are closer to Sanskrit. To read and comprehend many of them, one
would need some training in Indian spiritual studies, as many of them
liberally use Sanskrit words albeit transliterated in English. It was felt that
there is a need to present the key concepts of The Gita in plain English for
everyday folk, minimizing the use of Sanskrit words. These observations
led to the development of this manuscript.

Introduction

While there are many learned commentaries on the Gita written over
the centuries, this author has been greatly influenced by the authoritative
commentary and lucid explanations of difficult concepts by Sri
Madhwacharya, the 12th century ascetic who propounded the philosophy of
dualistic theism (concept of difference between the almighty Lord and
individual souls at all times and places). Sri Madhwacharya’s commentary
has been further elaborated and summarized by later day savants such as
Sri Padmanabha Teertha (13th Century), Sri Jaya Teertha (13th Century) Sri
Vadiraja Teertha (16th Century), Sri Raghavendra Teertha (17th century)
and others.
The Gita consists of 18 chapters with a total of 7011 verses in
Sanskrit. The Gita is part of the great Hindu epic The Mahabharata and
appears as Chapters 25 to 42, in the Book of Bheeshma in the
Mahabharata. Most of the verses appear in the anushtap meter, where
each verse has a total of 32 letters with 8 words in each of the four
quadrants. Some verses in the 15th chapter appear in trishtup meter with 44
words. As per Sri Raghavendra Teertha [GV], the 18 chapters can be
broadly classified into 3 sections with 6 chapters in each section. The first
section with chapters 1-6 (280 verses) broadly outlines how one can obtain
divine, spiritual knowledge (jnana upaya), the second section with chapters
7-12 (209 verses) focuses on devotion and divine, spiritual knowledge
(vijnana) that leads one to liberation, and the third section consisting of
chapters 13-18 (212 verses) elaborates on the concepts in the first two
sections. It is also believed that the Gita conveys at least 10 different
meanings, all of which are consistent with one another. An illustration of
multiple meanings in the Gita will appear in Chapter 2. It is also said that
the Gita has 3 major interpretations – historical, psychological, and
spiritual.

The Bhagavad Gita

The Gita and the Number 18
Numbers and numerology play an incredibly significant role in
Indian theology. In fact, the study of knowledge is termed ‘Sankhya Yoga’,
with Sankhya meaning ‘arithmetic’. The world around us is based on
numbers. We are constantly measuring, managing, quantifying all our
activities with the aid of numbers. We wake up at a certain time, we
work/study for certain hours, we travel a certain distance, we consume
some amount of food, we transact with certain currency, we perform
activities at a certain time, on a certain day, in a certain month, in a certain
year etc. And all these numbers and calculations are based on the position
and movement of celestial objects such as the Sun, Moon, stars etc.
The number 18 is very special in the Gita. Note that every letter has a
numerical equivalent based on the position of that letter in the Sanskrit
alphabet which has 16 vowels, 25 consonants and 10 semi vowels. Let us
review the numerical equivalent for the word ‘jaya’ (meaning victory)
which is made up of the letters ja (consonant in the 8th position) and ya (1st
semi vowel). Applying the grammatical rule of reading the numerical
representations in reverse order, the word ‘jaya’ is represented by number
18. Jaya which means victory, signifies the triumph of good over evil as
depicted in the Gita and its parent epic, The Mahabharata. Now let us
review the significance of number 18 in the Gita with the following facts
[SBG]1. The Gita has 18 chapters.
2. The Mahabharata of which the Gita is a part, has 18 volumes.
3. The great war of the Mahabharata which was the backdrop for the
Gita was fought over 18 days.
4. The armies consisted of 18 regiments with the Kauravas at 11 and
the Pandavas at 7

Introduction

5. Each regiment consisted of 21870 elephants, 21870 chariots, 65610
horses and 109350 soldiers. Each of these numbers sum up to 18.
For example, in case of 21870, 2+1+8+7+0 = 18
6. Duryodhana in his review of the Pandava army names 18 main
leaders
7. Sanjaya names the 18 conches sounded by the 18 Pandava leaders.
8. In the Gita chapter 10, the Lord describes His divine manifestation
(Vibhuti Roopa) in 18 verses (10.21 to 10.38)
9. The Lord Almighty’s omnipresence in the universe is described via
His 18 forms starting with Hamsa, in Katha Upanishad (2.2.2),
which is the basis for many concepts in the Gita.
Overview of Gita Chapters
The Gita has 18 chapters, each of which focusses on a specific topic
and at the same time builds upon the topics covered in previous chapters.
An enumeration of the chapters and a brief description of the contents of
each chapter are as follows:
Section 1: The Path to Divine Knowledge, Chapters 1 – 6 (280 verses)
Chapter 1 (47 verses) - Arjuna Vishada Yoga (Arjuna’s Distress): This
chapter sets the stage for the Gita. The two armies of cousins, the
Pandavas and the Kauravas were assembled in Kurukshetra, ready to
start the war. The proceedings in the war were narrated by Sanjaya, an
aide to the blind king Dhrutarashtra, father of the Kaurava brothers.
Before the start of the war, Arjuna looks at both the armies and realizes
that on both sides were many of his near and dear ones such as teachers,
cousins, uncles, nephews etc. He develops cold feet at the thought of
bloodshed between them. He wonders if he is doing the right thing by
waging this war as it would not only lead to bloodshed but also result in

6

The Bhagavad Gita

societal degradation. He advances many arguments as to why he should
avoid this war and find some other way to lead his life. At the end of this
chapter, Arjuna who is grief stricken, is seen sitting still in his chariot
after dropping his weapons, confused as to the way forward.
Chapter 2 (72 verses) - Sankhya Yoga (The Path of Doctrines): In this
chapter, the Lord answers Arjuna’s basic questions about the purpose of
life and related philosophical concepts. Sensing that Arjuna’s
reservations about fighting the war were due to his fear of losing his
loved ones, the Lord delves into the nature of individual souls, the
indestructibility of souls, the relationship between individual souls and
the Lord Almighty etc., to remind Arjuna that the Lord gave human
forms to individual souls to help them in their spiritual journey, and
everyone must play their dutiful role in society. The Lord urges Arjuna
not to despair over the hurt that may be caused to his loved ones in the
war, as they had taken the side of the evil king Duryodhana. Arjuna had
an obligation to fight the just war to protect his citizens. Lord Krishna
teaches Arjuna to focus on performing his prescribed duty of protecting
his citizens as an offering to Him and not let his emotions come in the
way. Chapter 2 can be considered a summary of the entire Gita as it
answers Arjuna’s (and through Arjuna, everyone’s) basic questions
about the purpose of life. The remaining chapters serve to expand on the
concepts presented in this chapter.
Chapter 3 (43 verses) - Karma Yoga (The Path of Action): In this
chapter, the Lord answers Arjuna’s questions regarding the paths of duty
(karma) and knowledge (jnana). Arjuna wonders if there is a way, he
could focus on acquiring knowledge and traverse the path of knowledge
(jnana) avoiding this dreadful war. The Lord logically answers Arjuna’s
doubts to convince him that everyone has an obligation to perform their
duties to society and as a prince, it was his responsibility to fight the just
war to protect his citizens. To perform one’s duty, one also needs to be
equipped with knowledge and in that sense, one needs to incorporate
both karma and jnana in one’s spiritual journey. Based on one’s innate

Introduction

7

nature, some may be prescribed a path that is dominant in action, and
others may be prescribed a path dominant in knowledge. This chapter
also has an excellent discussion on the Cyclic Order of the Universe.
Chapter 4 (42 verses) - Jnana Yoga (Wisdom in Action): This chapter is
predominantly about the spiritual knowledge that a seeker will need to
perform prescribed action (karma). Knowledge regarding the individual
souls, various deities and the attributes of the Lord are explained to
instill devotion in a seeker. The Lord explains that He incarnates in this
world from time to time to establish virtue and vanquish immorality.
Knowledge about the various types of actions – right action, wrong
action and non-action are also covered here.
Chapter 5 (29 verses) - Sanyasa Yoga (The Path of Renunciation):
Renunciation of rewards from actions is termed sanyasa and performing
prescribed duties as an offering to the Lord is termed yoga (action). In
this chapter, the Lord answers Arjuna’s questions on some fundamental
aspects of the two concepts of sanyasa and yoga. Arjuna’s argument was
that if renunciation were a better option than action, he could perhaps
adopt the life of an ascetic and avoid waging the war. The Lord however
describes the characteristics of a renunciant and clarifies that one must
incorporate both these paths to achieve self-realization. The Lord
reiterates that Arjuna must focus on performing his prescribed duty of
waging war to protect his citizens from the evil Kauravas. This chapter
also delves into the importance of detachment and self-control.
Chapter 6 (47 verses) – Atma Samyama Yoga (The Path of Self
Restraint) or Dhyana Yoga (The Path of Meditation): Yoga (or action)
has two components – external and internal. The external component
refers to actions performed as part of one’s prescribed duties which
would be visible to others. The internal component refers to dhyana (or
meditation). This chapter has a detailed discussion of dhyana yoga.
Characteristics of a true yogi are described. The physical aspect of
meditation such as place, physical pose, breath control etc., are also

8

The Bhagavad Gita

described. Requirements for moderation in consumption are also
discussed. To a question from Arjuna regarding the condition of those
who make a sincere attempt but are not able to successfully implement
karma and dhyana, the Lord teaches that no sincere effort is a waste, and
such seekers will get additional opportunities to complete their spiritual
journey.
Section 2: Divine, Spiritual Knowledge, Chapters 7 – 12 (209 verses)
Chapter 7 (30 verses) - Jnana Vijnana Yoga (The Path of Knowledge
and Wisdom): The first 6 chapters were broadly concerned with
descriptions of the methods and procedures (both external and internal)
to acquire divine, spiritual knowledge. The next 6 chapters describe in
more detail such divine, spiritual knowledge about the Lord Almighty,
which forms the principle message of the Gita. In earlier chapters 2 – 6,
there were some discussions on the Lord’s attributes which were
included contextually, but the next 6 chapters provide more exclusive
details about the Lord’ attributes. Chapter 7 provides a detailed
discussion of the two types of knowledge – indirect (ordinary
knowledge) and direct (special knowledge or wisdom). Indirect
knowledge (jnana) is that knowledge that is gained from scriptural
studies and through teachers. Direct knowledge (vijnana) is specialized
knowledge about the Lord that one obtains after self-realization. The
Lord describes His ownership of everything in the universe and stresses
that He is responsible for even the intrinsic attributes of objects. The
causes of ignorance, the influence of maya (delusion) on living beings,
and procedures to overcome maya are also discussed. The various types
of seekers who are devoted to the Lord are identified. This chapter ends
with the Lord stating that one who has proper knowledge about
Adhiyajna (Lord of Sacrifice) and Adhyatma (Prime Self), along with
that of Adhibhoota (Prime Material) and Adhidaiva (Prime Deities), and
who thinks of Him during the last moments will eventually reach Him.

Introduction

Chapter 8 (28 verses) - Akshara Brahma Yoga (The Imperishable Lord):
This chapter starts with Arjuna asking Krishna 8 questions about the
topics indicated towards the end of the previous chapter. Arjuna also
enquires about the need for and advantages of remembering the Lord
during one’s last moments. This chapter also details the journey of a soul
after leaving the physical body.
Chapter 9 (34 verses) - Raja Vidya, Raja Guhya Yoga (Path of Supreme
Knowledge and Supreme Secrets): This chapter continues with the
description of some of the important and subtle attributes and activities
of the Lord. In that sense, it is Supreme knowledge that is taught here.
The Lord uses the term ‘secretive’ to arouse curiosity in Arjuna (and
everyone else). While the Lord has infinite auspicious forms, attributes,
activities etc., there are eight activities of the Lord that directly impact
living beings. They are – creation (Srishti), sustenance (Stithi),
dissolution (laya), regulation (niayamana), knowledge (jnana),
ignorance (ajnana), bondage (bandha) and liberation (moksha). Together
they are called Janmadi ashtaka and they are also covered in this
chapter.
Chapter 10 (42 verses) - Vibhooti Yoga (Divine Manifestations): No one
can fully comprehend the Lord’s infinite, auspicious attributes. The
Lord, who is responsible for the creation, sustenance and dissolution of
the universe, powers everyone and everything. The Lord answers
Arjuna’s questions about His manifestations and presence in superior
entities. The Lord’s special presence among both sentient beings (such as
various deities, animals) and inert objects (such as mountains, rivers,
stars, weapons) bestows superiority on these entities. Divine
manifestations are of two types – direct, where the Lord incarnates in
different forms such as Rama, Krishna, Vedavyasa etc., and intrinsic,
where the Lord’s special presence in some objects gives them superiority
over other objects (ex: Meru’s superiority among mountains, Ganges’s
superiority among rivers).

10

The Bhagavad Gita

Chapter 11 (55 verses) - Vishwa Roopa Darshanam (The Lord’s
Universal Form): Arjuna, after learning about the Lord’s innumerable
manifestations, requests the Lord to allow him to see His Universal form
and is granted divine vision by Him. Arjuna sees the Lord having the
brightness of thousands of suns, pervading the entire world with infinite
limbs, faces with no beginning or end etc. The Lord’s infinite forms are
as real as the universe. This chapter also has a soulful prayer by Arjuna
on seeing the Lord’s universal form. While the Lord had previously
taught Arjuna about His greatness and attributes, the act of physically
seeing the Lord’s universal form completely solidifies Arjuna’s faith in
Sri Krishna’s teachings.
Chapter 12 (20 verses) - Bhakti Yoga (The Path of Devotion): The Lord
answers Arjuna’s questions comparing the worship of Goddess
Mahalakshmi and that of the Lord Almighty Narayana. Worshipping
Lord Narayana is an easier way to attain moksha, while pleasing
Mahalakshmi is difficult. Further, Sri Lakshmi operates under the Lord’s
control. One should propitiate Sri Lakshmi and other deities that are part
of the Lord’s entourage for maximum effect. Bhakti or devotion is
focusing one’s mind on the Lord. The Lord teaches other ways of
devotion using facilities such as intellect, studying scriptures, performing
prescribed duties etc. The last 8 verses describe the characteristics of an
ideal devotee who is dear to the Lord.
Section 3: Reiteration of Concepts in Sections 1 and 2, Chapters 13 – 18
(212 verses)
Chapter 13 (35 verses) - Kshetra Kshetrajna Yoga (The Field and the
Knower of the Field): The first section covers the tools and utilities to
acquire Divine knowledge which itself was covered in detail in the
second section. This third section expands on some of the critical issues
briefly covered in the first two sections. In chapter 7, verse (7.4), the
Lord briefly speaks about eight-fold nature which operates under His
command and control. This chapter details that field or theatre of

Introduction

11

operations and the one who knows them. The interaction between the
components of nature (sentient and inert) and living beings are also
discussed.
Chapter 14 (27 verses) - Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga (Division of
Qualities): This chapter has details on the three qualities of nature (sattv
– piety, rajas – passion, tamas – ignorance) which define one’s
personality. These concepts were introduced in chapter 3 (3.5) and are
expanded here. Creation of the universe through sentient Mother Nature
is described. The ways in which the three qualities bind a person are also
explained. The methods to escape from the clutches of the three qualities
are described.
Chapter 15 (20 verses) - Purushottama Yoga (Theology of the Supreme
Being): This chapter is considered by many to have the core teachings of
the Gita. The Bhagavad Gita has 700 verses spread among 18 chapters.
Interestingly, this chapter which has 20 verses has 700 letters (15 verses
have 32 letters each and the remaining 5 verses have 44 letters each)!
This gives credence to this chapter’s importance based on numerology.
While the Lord had previously described the components of the universe
such as living beings, inert objects, and the Lord Almighty, in this
chapter the Lord illustrates the interrelations among them using the
example of a banyan tree. In verse 15, the Lord explicitly states His
presence in everyone and declares that He is the primary subject matter
of the Vedas. In verses 16-20, the Lord emphatically describes Himself
as the Supreme Being intrinsically different from all other beings,
thereby convincingly establishing the philosophy of dualism (dvaita)
which was propagated by Sri Madhwacharya.
Chapter 16 (24 verses) - Daivasura Sampat Vibhaga Yoga (The Divine
and the Demoniac Nature): This chapter delves deep into the types of
human nature. In the previous chapters, there were many references to
pious and virtuous people with divine nature and to people with
demoniac nature. This chapter provides more details on human traits.

12

The Bhagavad Gita

These traits typically are intrinsic to an individual. One cannot judge
people based on external appearance, position in society etc. The
personality traits of people with divine nature and those with demoniac
nature are described in detail.
Chapter 17 (28 verses) - Shraddhatraya Vibhaga Yoga (The Threefold
Faith): In the previous chapters, especially chapter 14, the nature of
individuals influenced by the qualities of sattv, rajas, tamas were stated
a number of times. This chapter has more details on the concept of
threefold faith with detailed discussion on the impact of these qualities
on various issues such as faith, food habits, sacrificial rituals, charitable
giving, meditation etc.
Chapter 18 (78 verses) - Mokshasanyasa Yoga (Liberation and
Renunciation): This chapter starts with a discussion on the subtle
differences between renunciation (sanyasa) and relinquishment of the
rewards of labour (tyaga). The types of rewards from actions are also
discussed. The five prerequisites required for performing activity are
identified. Different types of knowledge, action, doers, intellect,
determination, and happiness are also discussed. Additional details on
the four societal categories of people are provided (this was briefly
indicated in (4.13)). The concept of liberation (moksha) is discussed in
detail in this chapter. The first 55 verses contain a discussion on the
topics identified so far. The Lord concludes His sermon in the next 17
verses. Arjuna responds to Lord Krishna’s teachings in verse 73.
Sanjaya, who has been describing the proceedings of the war and the
Lord’s glorious expounding of dharma (The Gita) to Arjuna,
euphorically concludes his commentary in the following 5 verses.
Organization of the Book
This book is primarily based on the interpretation of the Gita by Sri
Raghavendra Swamy (Sri Rayaru) in his pioneering work, Gita Vivruti.
Vivruti means ‘explanation’ and in the Gita Vivruti, Sri Rayaru has
consolidated unique interpretations on the Gita by Sri Madhwacharya (in

Introduction

13

his works Gita Bhashya, Gita Tatparya Nirnaya) and commentaries on
these two works by Sri Jaya Teertha (Prameya Deepika and Nyaya
Deepika). Gita Bhashya is the very first work of Sri Madhwacharya,
where he provided a unique interpretation of the Gita. In a subsequent
work, Gita Tatparya Nirnaya, Sri Madhwacharya provides detailed
arguments and the scriptural basis for many of the interpretations of Gita
Bhashya.
This book has 18 main chapters with each chapter corresponding to
the relevant chapter in the Gita. In each chapter, the book presents the
original Sanskrit verse along with a simple translation in English. At the
end of the original text, an explanation of key concepts covered in the
chapter is provided, based on authentic commentaries on the Gita by Sri
Raghavendra Teertha (Sri Rayaru) in his work Gita Vivruti and on lectures
by Sri Vidyasagara Madhava Teertha. At the end of each chapter, a
summary of that chapter is provided. The summary section also refers to
relevant verses in that chapter for clarity, and this section can be read
‘stand-alone’ by those readers who want a quick summary of the various
chapters. It is hoped that the readers will find this version useful in better
understanding the greatest psychological manual ever written – The
Bhagavad Gita.
Sri Vishnu Teertha from Madinur, a great saint philosopher of the
18 century has identified one verse from each chapter of the Gita as a
representation of the core tenets of that entire chapter in his work
Bhagavad Gita Saroddhara. This was done to help devotees who wanted
to chant the Gita everyday but could not chant all 700 verses. These core
verses are highlighted in this book in italics.
th

This book has 3 annexures. The first annexure contains a section
from the epic Varaha Purana which describes the glory of The Gita and
is typically read after completing a reading of the Gita. The second
annexure has a discussion on the philosophical interpretation of the Gita
with a sample illustration. The third annexure is about the core tenets of the

14

The Bhagavad Gita

philosophy of Sri Madhwacharya and the corresponding verses in the Gita
that support these tenets.
The last section of this book identifies literature cited in this book.
The principal references are the Gita, part of the great epic the
Mahabharata and commentaries on the Gita by Sri Madhwacharya, Sri
Jaya Teertha and Sri Raghavendra Teertha. The references are indicated by
their initials within square brackets. For example, the Gita Bhashya is
identified as [GB].

only a simple meaning is told here to aid general readers).

Benedictory Verse (Gita Vivruti) : After saluting Lord Narayana
(consort of Lakshmi), Sri Madhwacharya, and other teachers, we are
summarizing the concepts from Gita Bhashya, Gita Tatparya Nirnaya
and related commentaries which offer a unique perspective on the
Bhagavad Gita taught by Lord Sri Krishna.
Chapter Introduction: Sri Vedavyasa composed the great epic
Mahabharata which contains all the essential teachings from the Vedas,
and this allows even those who do not have access or eligibility to learn the
Vedas to gain necessary knowledge to help them in their spiritual journey.
The epic Mahabharata is spread over 18 volumes and the Bhagavad Gita
(or Gita, in short), is part of Bheeshma Parva (or the Book of Bheeshma).
The Mahabharata is compared to the divine flower parijata, and the Gita
is like the nectar (or essence) of the flower. Sri Raghavendra Teertha (Sri
Rayaru) has composed a unique commentary on the Gita titled, Gita
Vivruti [GV] which is a summary of the two commentaries on the Gita by

16

The Bhagavad Gita

Sri Madhwacharya namely, Gita Bhashya [GB] and Gita Tatparya
Nirnaya [GTN]. The Gita has 701 verses spread over 18 chapters. Sri
Rayaru has organized these 18 chapters into 3 sections of 6 chapters each.
The first section (chapters 1-6) broadly describes the processes and
prerequisites required to achieve divine, spiritual knowledge that one would
need in one’s spiritual journey. The second section (chapters 7-12)
describes the nature of the divine, spiritual knowledge and the third section
(chapters 13-18) expands on some of the key concepts covered in sections 1
and 2.
The Bhagavad Gita is a conversation between Arjuna, and Lord
Krishna as narrated by Lord Vedavyasa in the epic, Mahabharata. The
great war between the armies of the Kaurava and Pandava cousins, was
witnessed by Sanjaya, the aide of the blind King Dhrutarashtra who was
head of the Kaurava dynasty. Sanjaya rushes to Dhrutarashtra soon after the
fall of Bheeshma, the commander of the Kaurava army [Mahabharata,
Bheeshma Parva, Chapter 13]. The stunned Dhrutarashtra wants to know
everything that happened on the battlefield from the very beginning.
Sanjaya narrates all the events from the beginning of the war. He stays with
the king till the end of the war relaying all the events to him. He can do this
because Sage Vedavyasa grants him divine vision to remotely view the war
and provide him with updates.
All 47 verses in the first chapter and the first 10 verses in the second
chapter provide the background and context for Arjuna’s apprehensions
about the war, and Lord Krishna starts His sermon to Arjuna then onwards.
Dhrutarashtra starts by asking the following question to Sanjaya.
What did my Clan and the Pandavas do in Kurukshetra?

Chapter 1

17

Dhrutarashtra said: O Sanjaya! Assembled at Kuru Kshetra, the
designated land for committing righteous acts (Field of Righteousness),
what did my clan of Kauravas and Pandavas do? (1.1)
Comments: The first verse in the Gita starts with King
Dhrutarashtra asking the above question to his aide Sanjaya. The first word
here is ‘Dharma’ which is one of the names of the Lord Almighty who
shoulders (dharana) the universe. In that sense, the first verse also acts as a
benedictory verse of the Gita.
The King begins by asking Sanjaya what happened between his clan
(Kauravas) and the Pandavas in Kurukshetra which was known as Dharma
Kshetra or the ‘Field of Righteousness’. This question reveals the King’s
apprehensions. He was convinced that the Pandavas with the guidance of
Lord Krishna would be invincible (but Krishna had sworn not to take up
arms). On the other hand, Bheeshma was also known to be invincible and
so the King hoped against hope that his sons would not be defeated in this
war that was being fought in an area known as the ‘Field of Righteousness’.
Hence, he was surprised to hear that Bheeshma had fallen.
Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha Swamiji in his work Bhagavad Gita
Saroddhara [BGS] identifies this verse as the central piece of chapter 1.
After all, chapter 1 sets the context for the entire Gita, and it starts with
King Dhrutarashtra’s question. The theatre of war is our body, and the
armies represent the angelic and demoniac forces inside each of us. The
interaction between them is the context for the Gita.

The Bhagavad Gita

Sanjaya said: King Duryodhana, upon seeing the formation of the
Pandavas’ army, immediately rushed to his teacher Drona, and said as
follows. (1.2)
Comments: Sanjaya answers Dhrutarashtra’s question in the
following 9 verses. Sri Sumateendra Teertha in his Bhava Ratna Kosha
[BRK] draws attention to the use of the word ‘tu’ as implying
Duryodhana’s anxiety as soon as he saw the formidable Pandava army (‘tu’
is normally used to add emphasis). Hence, the Kaurava prince immediately
rushes to his teacher Drona. It is interesting to note that Duryodhana
approaches his teacher Drona and not the commander of the Kaurava
forces, Bheeshma, to give him information about the Pandava army,
perhaps to acknowledge the fact that many warriors in the Pandava army
were Drona’s students.

O My Teacher! Look at the formation of the mighty army of
Pandavas which has been organized by your clever student
Dhrushtadyumna, son of Drupada. (1.3)
Comments: Duryodhana reminds Drona that the formation of the
Pandava army has been organized by Dhrushtadyumna, a brilliant warrior
who learnt the art of warfare from Drona himself, implying that the
Pandavas have a formidable army formation. Duryodhana also refers to the
Pandavas’ army as mighty, even though his own army was much bigger.

Possessing heavy weapons are the brave warriors Yuyudhana
(Satyaki), Virata, and King Drupada, all Maharathas. They are as capable
as Bheema and Arjuna. (1.4)
Other brave warriors include Drushtaketu, Chekitana, Kashiraja who
are extraordinarily strong, Purujit, Kuntibhoja and Shybhya who are
superior among men. (1.5)
Yudhamanyu, the brave warrior, Uttamowja, the strong warrior,
Abhimanyu, son of Subhadra, and sons of Draupadi are also here. They too
are Maharathas. (1.6)
Comments: Duryodhana recognizes and names 18 leaders from the
Pandava army whom he considers as being comparable to Bheema and
Arjuna in valor. They are – Dhrushtadyumna, Satyaki, Virata, Drupada,
Drushtaketu, Chekitana, Kashiraja, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, Shybhya,
Yudhamanyu, Uttamowja, Abhimanyu and the five sons of Draupadi
(Parativindya, Sutasoma, Shrutakeerti, Shataneeka, Shrutakarma).These
leaders were termed ‘Maharathas’, meaning they were capable of singlehandedly fighting 10,000 enemy soldiers. They were experts in the use of
both types of weapons – astra and shastra. Here, astra refers to weapons
such as arrows that are launched after praying and invoking a deity, and
shastra refers to arrows that are launched without such invocation.
Interestingly, Duryodhana does not name Krishna who was
charioteering Arjuna. This is perhaps due to Krishna’s vow that He would
not take up arms in the war. Duryodhana probably thought Krishna did not
count if He was not fighting. A big miscalculation!

O Drona! Superior among the wise men! Now I will enumerate the

Our side includes yourself, Bheeshma, Karna, Krupa who has won
many wars, Ashwatthama, Vikarna and Bhoorishravas, son of Somadatta.
(1.8)
Along with them are many warriors ready to sacrifice their lives for
my sake. They are all well versed in wars and are armed with heavy
weapons. (1.9)
Comments: Duryodhana now names 7 leaders from his side. He
indicates that they are all ready to sacrifice their lives for him. Duryodhana
is looking at this war purely to justify holding onto the Pandavas’ share of
the kingdom and believes that everyone in his side is fighting to please him
and not for any higher cause. It is interesting to note that while Duryodhana
names 18 leaders from the Pandavas, he only rattles 7 names from his side.
Further he does not name his brothers such as Dushasana. This points to
some doubts in his mind about his brothers’ capabilities.

But our army headed by Bheeshma is not strong enough to defeat

Chapter 1

21

Comments: After reviewing the two armies, Duryodhana is
beginning to have doubts about the capabilities of his army. He knows that
his is not a just cause, but as a representation of Kali, the evil soul, it is in
his nature to adamantly get into a war even when he knows that he is wrong
and that his side is not capable of winning. Note that while
Dhrushtadyumna is the commander of the Pandavas’ army, Duryodhana
recognizes that the real leader of the Pandavas is the hugely experienced
Bheema.

Hence all of you need to position yourselves in your designated spots

Comments: Duryodhana is very particular about protecting
Bheeshma as he is worried that Bheeshma’s fall would discourage his
entire army. The fact that he was worried about the safety of Bheeshma
who was the most capable warrior in his side is an indication of his fear.

To inject confidence in Duryodhana, the very courageous Bheeshma
who is the senior most Kaurava, roared like a lion and sounded his conch.
(1.12)
Comments: Bheeshma recognizes that Duryodhana is so petrified
looking at the strength of the Pandava army that he asks Drona and others
to protect him. In fact, it is the duty of Bheeshma, as the commander, to
protect the Kaurava army. To instill confidence in Duryodhana and the

22

The Bhagavad Gita

other Kauravas, Bheeshma signals his readiness by his lion like roar and
the sounding of his conch.

Conch-shells, bugles, trumpets, drums, and cow horns were sounded
loudly by the Kauravas which resulted in their sound filling the entire
space. (1.13)
Comments: Taking a cue from Bheeshma, other Kaurava leaders
sounded various organs to signal their readiness and command their troops
to get ready. It is interesting to note that while Bheeshma sounds his conch,
a musical instrument with spiritual significance which has a pleasant sound,
other leaders sound different instruments, many making harsh sounds not in
harmony with each other. Perhaps an indication of disharmony and disunity
among the Kauravas.

At this time, Lord Madhava (Krishna) and Arjuna, son of Pandu,
who were seated on a magnificent chariot pulled by white horses, sounded
their respective divine conch shells. (1.14)
Comments: Lord Krishna and Arjuna sounding their conches while
seated in a horse drawn chariot also has a spiritual interpretation. As noted
by Sri Vidyamanya Teertha in his GPM, as per the Upanishads, the chariot
is a representation of the human body. The wandering horses represent the
sense organs, and the road travelled represents the objects of sense
pleasure. The charioteer (Krishna) represents the intellect, and the leash
which controls the horses represents the mind. The charioteer (Krishna) and
the passenger (Arjuna) respectively represent the Supreme Soul and the
individual soul resident in each body. The conch is shaped like the

Chapter 1

23

primordial symbol ‘Om’ which is the root letter of all scriptures. Hence the
conversation between Krishna and Arjuna represents the collective wisdom
of scriptures such as the Vedas.

and Sahadeva sounded Sughosha and Manipushpaka, respectively. (1.16)
The King of Kashi an expert bowman, Shikhandi a great warrior on

sounded their respective conch shells. (1.17)
Likewise, King Drupada, the son of Draupadi and the strong-armed
brave son of Subhadra (Abhimanyu,) all sounded their respective conch
shells. (1.18)

Comments: It is interesting to note that while the Kauravas used
various instruments to sound their readiness, the Pandavas uniformly
sounded their respective conches to the maximum effect to display unity.

as if to warn them of their impending defeat and destruction.

Looking at King Dhrutarashtra’s children who were ready to wage
the war, Arjuna, (the one whose chariot bears the flag of Lord Hanuman),
just when the time had come to operate the weapons, held up his bow, and
spoke to Lord Krishna as follows. (1.20)
Comments: Arjuna wants to take a good look at the armies which
consisted of all major, accomplished rulers and warriors of that time. In this
verse, a reference is made to the flag of Arjuna’s chariot which bears the
figure of Lord Hanuman, the great warrior from the Ramayana. This
indicates that both the Supreme Soul (paramatma = Lord Krishna) and the
superior soul among all individual souls (jeevottama = vayudeva =
Hanuman) are protecting Arjuna.

war to please the evil minded Duryodhana (son of Dhrutarashtra). (1.23)
Comments: After Duryodhana’s review of the armies, it is the turn
of Arjuna to survey the forces assembled on the battlefield. Arjuna’s review
and feelings of apprehension about waging the war form the basis for Sri
Krishna’s sermon (Gita).

The Bhagavad Gita

Sanjaya said: O Bhaarata! (Dhrutarashtra, from the lineage of King
Bharata)! Lord Hrishikesha (Krishna), addressed thus by Gudakesha
(Arjuna) positioned the grand chariot in between the two armies. (1.24)
Turning the chariot towards Bheeshma, Drona and other kings, Lord
Krishna said - O Partha (Arjuna)! Look at all the Kauravas assembled here.
(1.25)
Comments: Arjuna is referred to as Gudakesha – the one who has
conquered sleep (gudaka). Sleep, along with lethargy represents tamas
(ignorance). Sleep is probably the most difficult state for one to overcome.
Thus, anyone who can control sleep is said to have control over sense
organs. Hence, Arjuna is most eligible to receive the sermon from the Lord.
The Lord is referred to as Hrishikesha, one who has control over
everyone’s sense organs and indeed on everyone and everything in the
universe.

Looking at both the armies, Arjuna sees warriors who were like his

brothers, sons, grandsons, friends, and colleagues. (1.26)

of Kunti) was overwhelmed by emotion and addressed Sri Krishna with

Comments: While Arjuna knew that many of his near and dear ones

them assembled in one place. Faced with the prospect of many of them
dying, regardless of who won the war, Arjuna is overcome with grief and
emotion.
Sri Rayaru in GV provides an explanation for the term vishada
which is used to express Arjuna’s emotion. Vishada means mental
weakness caused by grief, which is a result of delusion, which in turn is
caused by the fear of losing loved ones.

Arjuna said: O Krishna! I am looking at my relatives and friends
gathered here to wage the war. (1.28)
Looking at them, my limbs are weakening, my face is crumpling, my
body is trembling, and my hair is bristling. (1.29)
Comments: From this verse, till the end of this chapter is a
description of Arjuna’s anxiety and fear when faced with the prospect of
waging the war which would result in the loss of lives of multitudes of
people including many of his near and dear ones. Note that Arjuna begins
describing his anxiety to the Lord by addressing Him as Krishna. This has a
special significance. Sri Madhwacharya in his Gita Bhashya [GB] (5th
Chapter), interprets Krishna as ‘Lokarakshaka’, the one who controls
everyone and everything in the universe. By using this term, Arjuna
expresses his faith that Lord Krishna will have a solution to his grief.

Comments: Sri Madhwacharya in his Gita Bhashya [GB], interprets
the Lord’s name Keshava, as the one who inspires even deities Brahma (ka)
and Rudra (esha). Arjuna, by using this term to address the Lord expresses
his complete faith that Lord Krishna who inspires even deities Brahma and
Rudra, can surely help him. Arjuna’s sensing of bad omens reflects his
weak mind (If these omens were indeed predicting bad outcomes, he would
have lost the war, which did not happen).

The very people for whom we work hard to provide comfort and

O Madhusoodana! Even if they hurt me, I do not want to kill them. I
would not kill them even if I could win all three worlds by doing so. Why
would I kill them just for some land? (1.35)
Comments: Arjuna is overcome with emotion and states that even if
his enemies attacked him when he turned away from war, he would not
want to harm them. Even if victory would net him all the three worlds, he
would not value them if he had to kill his loved ones. Why then would he
wage a war just for some land?
Note that Arjuna addresses Krishna as Madhusoodana. Demons
Madhu and Kaitabha were born out of Krishna’s sweat and in that sense are
Krishna’s children. As they grew up, they became very evil, and Krishna
had no choice but to destroy them. Arjuna indicates here that he does not
have such strong will power.

O Madhava! It is not proper for us to kill Dhrutarashtra’s sons who
are our own relatives. How can we achieve happiness by killing our own
people? (1.37)
Comments: Arjuna refers to the Kauravas as atatayina which means
those who have committed one or more of the following six sins – torching
others, poisoning others, using weapons against the unprotected, stealing
others’ land, money, and women. It is the duty of someone in Arjuna’s
position to destroy those who commit these sins. It is his duty to preserve
and protect the innocent in society. While Arjuna is aware that the
Kauravas deserve to be punished, he is worried that doing so would result
in collateral damage – that is the death of his relatives, elders and teachers
which would result in him accumulating sins.

These Kauravas who are greedy for the kingdom have no knowledge
of the sins they would accumulate by killing their family members and by
betraying their friends. (1.38)
O Janardana! How can we, who understand the perils of destroying
families, not be aware of the need to stay away from these sinful acts?
(1.39)
With the destruction of the families, traditional familial virtues will
perish. When virtuousness declines, unrighteousness will permeate society.
(1.40)
O Vaarshneya! The rise of unrighteousness will cause surviving
women to stray away from morality. Women devoid of morals result in
unholy families. (1.41)
Rise of unholy families will push the lineage of children and
grandchildren to hell and departed elders who are deprived of appropriate
offerings will also fall into hell. (1.42)
Comments: Arjuna tries to make a case for avoiding the battle by
putting forward additional arguments. His initial argument was that the war
would result in the loss of many innocent lives, including elders and
teachers who were pious and revered. Here he argues that the loss of many
men in the war would lead to instability in society and give rise to unholy
families. This would result in the loss of compulsory rituals such as
offerings to departed elders. Arjuna also says that the Kauravas are blinded
by their greed and are unable to see the perils of such a war. But how could
the Pandavas who are a lot more knowledgeable about such perils be
similarly blinded?

Such sinful deeds by destroyers of families will result in corruption
of virtuous classes and decline of virtuous familial traditions. (1.43)
O Janardana! We have heard from elders that people whose virtuous
familial traditions are destroyed are sure to fall into hell. (1.44)
Alas! We are about to commit a great sin by killing our own people
because of our greed for kingdom and for the sake of happiness. (1.45)
It would be better for me if I relinquished my weapons and offered
no resistance while Dhrutarashtra’s sons kill me in this war. (1.46)
Comments: Arjuna now summarizes his arguments for staying away
from the war. Firstly, he would be committing a great sin by killing near
and dear ones which included elders and teachers who were pious and
revered. Secondly, the loss of millions of men would lead to instability in
society due to straying away from traditions related to a class (jati dharma)
and traditions specific to families (kula dharma). In addition, anyone
causing these would accrue sins to their departed elders. Arjuna laments
that he is about to commit great sins in waging this war, the purpose of
which is to gain the kingdom. He is convinced that it is better for him to
relinquish his weapons and let the Kauravas kill him as that would prevent
him from accruing sins and in fact may lead him to heavens hereafter for
his noble act.

Chapter 1

As will be seen later, Arjuna fights the war and the Pandavas
successfully rule their kingdom for many years. None of Arjuna’s fears
come true. The evil clan of the Kauravas and their supporters such as the
virtuous but guilty Bheeshma and Drona are vanquished, and society does
not fall apart. In fact, Bharat enjoys a long, peaceful and prosperous period
under Pandavas’ rule. The Gita clearly suggests that omens do not have
any predictive value and chastise superstitious practices. Arjuna’s
experience of bad omens reflect his weak mental condition which is caused
by his excessive attachment to his near and dear ones.

Sanjaya said: Having said thus, Arjuna, stricken with deep sorrow in
his mind, drops his bow and arrows and sits still in the middle of his
chariot. (1.47)
Comments: While Arjuna indicates to Krishna his anxiety and
unwillingness to wage war, his relinquishing of his bow and arrows is a
signal to his large army that he is not yet ready to start the war. (The army
of course could not have heard the conversation between Arjuna and
Krishna). This action has led to their enemies drawing their own
conclusions which Krishna indicates later.
Summary of Chapter 1
The Bhagavad Gita is a conversation between Arjuna and Lord
Krishna as narrated by Lord Vedavyasa in the epic, Mahabharata. The
great war between the armies of the Kaurava and the Pandava cousins, was
witnessed by Sanjaya, aide of the blind King Dhrutarashtra who was head
of the Kaurava dynasty. Sanjaya rushes to Dhrutarashtra soon after the fall

34

The Bhagavad Gita

of Bheeshma, the commander of the Kaurava army. The stunned
Dhrutarashtra wants to know everything that happened on the battlefield
from the very beginning. Sanjaya narrates all the events from the beginning
of the war. He stays with the king till the end of the war relaying all the
events to him. He can do this because Sage Vedavyasa grants him divine
vision to view the war remotely and provide Dhrutarashtra the updates.
The King starts by asking Sanjaya as to what happened between his
clan (the Kauravas) and the Pandavas in Kurukshetra (which is known as
Dharma Kshetra or the ‘Field of Righteousness’) (1.1). This question
reveals the King’s apprehensions. He is convinced that the Pandavas with
the guidance of Lord Krishna would be invincible (but, Krishna has sworn
not to touch or take up arms). On the other hand, Bheeshma, the very
epitome of justice, was also known to be invincible. The King was
therefore hoping against hope that his sons would not be defeated,
especially in a war that was being fought in an area known as the Field of
Righteousness. So, he was shocked to hear that Bheeshma had fallen.
Sanjaya responds, saying that initially Duryodhana looks at the Pandava
army and rushes to inform his teacher Dronacharya about its strength. He
makes sure to let him know that the army is being led by Dhrishtadyumna,
a student of Drona himself. Then he goes on to enumerate other great
leaders on the side of the Pandavas. These leaders were termed
‘Maharathas’, meaning they were capable of single-handed fighting with
10,000 enemy soldiers. In all, Duryodhana enumerates 18 leaders from the
Pandavas’ side, other than the five Pandava brothers. Interestingly, he does
not recognize Krishna as being a part of the Pandava side. This is because
Krishna had vowed not to use any arms in the war. Duryodhana obviously
did not realize the invaluable advice and guidance that Krishna would be
providing to Arjuna. Ultimately, this miscalculation had lead to the
Kauravas’ defeat. This illustrates the peril of ignoring the Lord who is
responsible for everything in this universe, just because one cannot
physically see Him. (1.2-1.6). Duryodhana then enumerates the great
warriors on his side which included – Dronacharya, Bheeshma, Karna,
Krupa, Ashwatthama, Vikarna and Bhoorishravas. However, he did not
expect the Pandavas to turn up with a huge, well-organized army. He

Chapter 1

35

knows that in addition to the experienced warriors, the Pandava army also
included the 5 young children of Draupadi and each of them was brave and
capable. He also knows that while Dhrushtadyumna is the commander of
the Pandava army, it is really the invincible Bheema who is their star
warrior. Duryodhana is now clearly very perturbed. He wants to ensure that
Bheeshma is well protected as he sees Bheeshma as extremely critical to
his victory. He asks Dronacharya and others to ensure Bheeshma’s safety
(1.7-1.11). At this time, sensing Duryodhana’s worry, Bheeshma decided to
instil confidence in him by loudly roaring like a lion and sounding his
conch. Other soldiers in the Kaurava army follow by sounding drums,
trumpets, bugles etc, and the collective sound seemed to envelope the entire
space. Now it is the turn of the Pandavas. Sri Krishna and Arjuna, while
seated in their chariots sound their respective conches followed by other
leaders in their army. The collective sound of these conches reverberated
across earth and sky and seemed to shatter the hearts of King
Dhrutarashtra’s sons. It is interesting to note that while the Kauravas used
various instruments to sound their readiness, the Pandavas uniformly
sounded their respective conches for the maximum effect. Lord Krishna
and Arjuna sounding their conches while seated in a horse drawn chariot
also has a spiritual interpretation. The chariot is a representation of the
human body as noted in the Upanishads. The horses which pull the chariot
represent the sense organs, and the roads travelled represent objects of
sense pleasure. The charioteer (Krishna) represents the intellect, and the
leash which controls the horses represents the mind. The charioteer
(Krishna) and the passenger (Arjuna) represent the Supreme soul and the
individual soul resident in each body. The conch is shaped like the
primordial symbol ‘Om’ which is the root letter of all scriptures. Hence the
conversation between Krishna and Arjuna represents the collective wisdom
of all the scriptures such as the Vedas (1.12-1.19). Arjuna requests Krishna
to take the chariot to the middle of the battleground so that he can have a
good look at both the armies. He recognizes his teachers, cousins, nephews,
uncles, grand uncles, children, friends etc., and gets very depressed. He is
distressed at the very thought of waging a war where he himself might kill
many of his near and dear ones. Arjuna tells Krishna that his body is

36

The Bhagavad Gita

trembling, and that he is unable to hold his weapons. He was feeling
disoriented and disillusioned. He was further seeing bad omens and felt
there was nothing good coming out of this war. He says he does not crave
for victory, or a kingdom won after losing so many near and dear ones
(1.20-1.39). He reasons that with massive destruction of men, familial
values would perish, and unrighteousness would take over society. Arjuna
says that such a war has no benefits either here or hereafter. He says he
would rather drop his weapons and let the Kauravas kill him rather than be
responsible for such a destructive war. Saying thus, Arjuna drops his
weapon to the ground and sits in his chariot feeling extremely dejected
(1.40-1.47).
The rest of the Gita is a sermon from Lord Krishna to Arjuna to help
him overcome his distress and doubts. The dropping of weapons by Arjuna
is equivalent to one abdicating one’s responsibility. At this stage, the
following points are worth noting: Duryodhana was also distressed after
looking at the Pandavas’ army but there is a big difference between the
distress of Duryodhana and that of Arjuna. Duryodhana was distressed at
the thought of not being able to win the war and thereby usurp the
Pandavas share of the kingdom illegally. On the other hand, Arjuna’s
distress was out of compassion towards his loved ones. Duryodhana shows
no such compassion. Arjuna was not afraid of fighting as he had fought
many wars before and had won them. But this time it was different. His
enemies were people he cared for dearly.

Chapter 2 – The Path of Doctrines
Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 72 verses is termed Sankhya
Yoga (The Path of Doctrines). In this chapter, the Lord answers Arjuna’s
basic questions about the purpose of life and other related philosophical
concepts. Sensing that Arjuna’s reservations about fighting the war were
due to his fear of losing his loved ones, the Lord delves into the nature of
individual souls, the indestructibility of souls, the relationship between
individual souls and Himself. He reminds Arjuna that He gave human
forms to individual souls to help them in their spiritual journey and that
everyone must play their dutiful role in society. In verses 2.12 to 2.39, the
Lord lectures on the nature of individual souls and the Supreme soul (Lord
Almighty). In verse 2.39, the Lord tells Arjuna how to acquire divine,
spiritual knowledge which is explained in brief in verses 2.45 to 2.51. In
these verses, the Lord discusses the concept of nishkama karma, that is,
performing prescribed duties without expectations. The Lord urges Arjuna
not to despair over the hurt that may be caused to his elders and teachers in
the war, as they had chosen to support the evil king Duryodhana and
reminds Arjuna that he had an obligation to fight this just war to protect his
citizens. Lord Krishna teaches Arjuna to focus on performing his
prescribed duty of protecting his citizens as an offering to the Lord
Almighty and not let his emotions come in the way. Chapter 2 can be
considered the foundational chapter of the entire Gita as it answers
Arjuna’s (and through Arjuna, everyone’s) basic questions about the
purpose of life. The remaining chapters serve to expand on the concepts
presented in this chapter.

narration of the next set of events starting with Lord Krishna’s questioning
of Arjuna’s actions.

The Lord said: O Arjuna! What caused this delusion for you to give
up your duties at the time of crisis? This is not expected of wise men, it
does not lead to glory, or heavens and it only brings disrepute. (2.2)
Comments: By stating that Arjuna is uttering words unworthy of
wise men, Lord Krishna is giving a hint of the concept of ‘prajnavada’
which will be elaborated in verse 2.11.

O Partha! Do not yield to weakness. This is not worthy of you. O

and get ready to wage this war. (2.3)
Comments: Krishna asking Arjuna to get up has both literal and
figurative meanings. In verse 1.47, it was noted that Arjuna was sitting still
in his chariot, refusing to wage the war. Now Krishna is directing Arjuna to

Chapter 2

39

get out of his chariot and wage the just war. It also indicates the need to get
into action in pursuance of one’s duty. Krishna also refers to Arjuna as
Parantapa (destroyer of enemies), to remind him that he has waged and
won many wars earlier and need not be afraid to fight this war.

able to relate to Krishna’s advice and reiterates his position in 5 verses.
Arjuna indicates that even if he were to approach the war as a duty, he
could not hurl his arrows at Bheeshma and Drona who have taught him
much and are worthy of worship.

It is better to live by begging for alms than kill our great teachers.
How can one enjoy the luxuries of a kingdom attained by waging a war and
spilling the blood of these teachers who are of great eminence? (2.5)
Comments: Arjuna argues that it is not worth winning the war which
would entail killing his elders and teachers who are pious and God fearing,
as that would not lead to any joy in this world and would bring difficulties
hereafter also. A better option would be to give up fighting and live by
begging for alms.

I do not know which is better, that we win, or they win over us. We
do not desire to live by killing the sons of Dhrutarashtra who are standing

Comments: Arjuna argues that if he wins the war by killing the
Kauravas, it is in a way equivalent to losing, as the war would also entail
the death of many near and dear ones. Arjuna, thus is not able to decide the
better option. Prior to this verse, Arjuna seemed to have made up his mind
that he would not wage the war, but now after reflecting on Krishna’s
advice he is weighing both the options.

his mind. He surrenders to Krishna and asks for Krishna’s guidance.

Comments: Here again we see that Arjuna is conflicted. He declares
that even if he were to follow his prescribed duties and wage the war to
protect the citizens from the evil Kauravas, and even if his actions result in
him accruing enough good credits to become the leader of heavens, he
would be unable to control his grief over the prospect of losing near and
dear ones.

Sanjaya said: Gudakesha (Arjuna, the one who has conquered sleep),
Parantapa (Arjuna - the destroyer of enemies), thus addressed Govinda,
(Krishna - the controller of senses). Saying that he would not fight the war
(as he is conflicted), he became silent. (2.9)
Comments: Arjuna is referred to as Gudakesha – the one who has
conquered sleep. Sleep, along with lethargy represents tamas or ignorance.
Arjuna has won over these and hence is eligible to receive the sermon from
the Lord. Further, Arjuna is termed Parantapa, the one who has destroyed
enemies in many wars. Sri Rayaru in GV draws attention to the use of the
term ‘ha’ which indicates surprise. Sanjaya seems to be indicating that it
was a surprise to him that Arjuna with such qualities, was in a despondent
mood.

inconsistent position that Arjuna had placed himself in.

Comments: Elders and teachers such as Bheeshma and Drona, even
though worthy of worship, were on the side of evil and so Arjuna should
not have been grieving over their impending death. Krishna uses the word
‘Prajnaavada’ which has two meanings – one who says whatever that
comes to one’s mind and secondly, one whose words are not acceptable to

There was no time when neither Me nor you nor any of these kings

Comments: Krishna goes on to answer three conflicts in Arjuna’s
mind which are causing him distress. Is the distress due to a fear of the loss
of souls of loved ones? Or is it due to a fear of the loss of their physical
bodies? Or is it due to a fear of the loss of their bodies which are equated to
their souls?
He answers the first question in this verse where he categorically
states that souls are eternal and have no beginning or end. This applies to

Chapter 2

43

Arjuna, to all kings assembled at the warfront (and by extension everyone)
and especially to the Lord Almighty, which is indicated using the word ‘tu’.
The fact that the Lord is especially eternal is supported by scriptures
such as Katha Upanishad (2.5.13) which describes the Lord as ‘nityo
nityanam’ (He is eternal among eternals). While the individual souls are
eternal, the Lord’s eternality is superior to that of individual souls. Living
beings whose souls are eternal do undergo creation and destruction of their
physical bodies (birth and death), but the Lord who has a transcendental
body does not experience creation or destruction. Hence, He is said to have
superior eternality compared to individual souls. The other two questions
are answered in later verses 2.13 and 2.20.
A question that arises at this stage is - how could Arjuna, himself a
realized soul as an incarnation of deity Devendra, the king of all deities,
harbour such doubts about the nature of the Lord? Sri Madhwacharya
answers this question [GTN] by stating that the Lord in the form of
Vedavyasa in the great epic Mahabharata elaborates the sermon in more
detail for the benefit of humanity.

Just as one experiences childhood, youth, and old age, one similarly
experiences attainment of another body. So, the wise ones do not grieve
over the loss of the physical body. (2.13)
Comments: While the verse 2.12 deals with the issue of a soul’s
nature, in this verse the Lord describes the nature of one’s physical body.
Just as one goes through changes in the physical body in one’s lifetime,
death is inevitable in the end. Hence Arjuna has no reason to grieve over
the loss of the physical bodies of his loved ones in a just war.

Attachment Causes Misery

Do sense organs and sensory objects cause one to experience cold or
heat, happiness, or sadness? No. One experiences temporary happiness or
sadness when these are accompanied by attachment. O Bharata! Rid
yourself of attachment which is the real reason for happiness or sadness.
(2.14)
Comments: If Arjuna’s distress is due to him not being able to
interact with his near and dear ones after they die in war, the Lord states
that such distress is due to attachment. Interaction of sense organs with
sensory objects does not in itself cause happiness or sadness. It is only
when such interaction is accompanied by attachment to the physical body
does one experience happiness or sadness. Krishna uses the example of
heat and cold as sensory objects that cause pleasure or misery when they
encounter one’s skin (the only sense organ that covers one’s entire body).
A cool breeze in summer may cause pleasure but the same breeze in winter
would cause discomfort. The difference is because of one’s attachment to
the body. Again, when one is asleep one does not feel distress in the
presence of an object that would emit an unpleasant sound. However, when
that person is awake the same sound would be objectionable. Krishna
advises Arjuna to wage the just war and rid himself of attachment to his
loved ones which is causing him distress.

O Arjuna, Superior among men! One, who is equipoised in

Chapter 2

45

Comments: Arjuna could argue that one way for him to avoid
distress would be to avoid waging the war which could result in loss of
loved ones. In this case, the issue of attachment does not arise. So, why not
avoid the war? Lord Krishna says that waging a just war is Arjuna’s duty
and the way that Arjuna can avoid distress is by ridding himself of
attachment to his near and dear ones. Such an action will also result in
Arjuna achieving liberation hereafter.

No good comes out of bad deeds. Also, there are no bad results from
good deeds. The learned seers who have realized the Lord Almighty are
convinced of these two facts. (2.16)
Comments: Arjuna has expressed concern that he will incur sins by
killing elders and teachers during the war. However, these elders are on the
side of evil and it is Arjuna’s duty to fight for justice. In this verse, Krishna
says that no sin is incurred by performing good deeds.
There is a second meaning to this verse as stated by Sri Rayaru
[GV]- Inert nature is not subject to creation and destruction, and hence is
eternal. The Lord Almighty is also eternal and indestructible. These two
concepts have been traditionally taught by knowledgeable seers.
How can one say that inert matter and the Lord Almighty are eternal,
and not subject to creation and dissolution? Sri Rayaru [GV] provides an
answer by referring to the first line of this verse where - asat refers to
prime material nature, sat refers to the Lord Almighty, abhava refers to
prag abhava and pradhwamsa abhava, and na vidyate means ‘does not
exist’. This means that prime matter and the Lord Almighty do not have the
conditions of the above abhava twins. Thus, the two entities are said to be
eternal.

46

The Bhagavad Gita

What are the abhava twins? This can be explained with an example.
Before a potter creates a pot out of clay, the pot is said to have the
condition of prior non-existence (prag abhava). When such a pot is
destroyed, the pot is in the condition of post non-existence (pradhwamsa
abhava). The material cause for the creation of the universe is inert nature.
The Lord Almighty is the instrumental cause for the creation of the
universe. Inert nature and the Lord Almighty are not subject to the
conditions of prior non-existence (prag abhava) and post non-existence
(pradhwamsa abhava), and thus are not subject to creation or destruction.
Sri Rayaru [GV] quotes Sri Narahari Teertha [GBBPN] who in his
commentary on the Gita had an additional interpretation for the use of the
word ‘api’ (meaning ‘also’) in this verse. This word when combined with
the phrase ‘learned seers’, implies that the eternality of inert nature and the
Lord Almighty is known through the traditional teachings of learned seers
and through scriptural evidence from the epic Vishnu Purana.
Sri Vishwesha Teertha in his Gita Saroddhara [GS] provides a third
interpretation for the first line in this verse by applying the concepts to
living beings – the physical body that is subject to birth is not perishable
(as it is perishable) and the unborn soul does not perish.

Comments: The entities referred to are not subject to decay and
hence are imperishable and eternal. These entities include the Lord
Almighty, individual souls, space (avyakrita akasha) and the letters (the 51
letters in the Sanskrit alphabet). Space is known as avyakrita akasha as it

eternal, and self-supporting.

O Bharata! It is said that the eternal soul’s visible physical body is
perishable, but the Lord Almighty, the Supreme Soul, is imperishable (not
subject to four-way destruction). Hence, fight this war as worship to the
indwelling Lord Aprameya, the one who is not limited by space, time, or
attributes. (2.18)
Comments: The individual soul is a reflection of the Lord as in a
mirror. Some argue that when the mirror which they consider is upadhi (the
conditioning medium) is destroyed, the reflection no longer exists. Sri
Rayaru [GV] explains that the upadhi in the example of a reflection in the
mirror is the intrinsic body of the individual soul and not the physical body.
The intrinsic body (swaroopa deha) of a soul never perishes. The Lord is
eternal, has no blemishes, does not experience decay or destruction of
body, as His body is transcendental. The individual soul’s intrinsic body is
also indestructible, and in that sense, the individual soul is deemed to have
some similarity with the Lord. Hence the intrinsic body of the individual
soul is the upadhi in the example of comparing the Lord and the individual
soul to the original and the mirror reflection. Also, if the Lord Almighty
and individual souls have similar attributes such as indestructibility, then
why should one perform duties as a worship to the Lord? Firstly, the
individual soul is dependent on the Lord and secondly, the Lord has special
characteristics far and beyond those of individual souls. The Lord pervades
everywhere. Sri Rayaru also states [GV] that the Lord is not subject to the
fourfold destruction – (i) of the body (as His body is transcendental), (ii) of
the soul (as He is eternal), (iii) of attributes (as He is full of infinite
auspicious attributes and is devoid of any blemishes) and (iv) of happiness
(as He is devoid of misery). He is superior to individual souls and hence is
worthy of worship.

may kill his elders and teachers in the war. However, no one can
independently kill someone or get killed by someone. Further, no one
experiences destruction of their soul, and the Lord is the only independent
entity. Hence, Arjuna’s grief is misplaced.

and it is not subject to decay. Even when the physical body is destroyed,
the soul does not perish. (2.20)
Comments: This verse has origins in the Katha Upanishat and
provides the scriptural reference to the concepts in the previous verse.
A second interpretation of this verse is as follows: The Lord does not
experience bodily birth and death. All His incarnations such as Rama and
Krishna are eternal, and from time to time He manifests Himself and makes
Himself visible or invisible. The aspect of the Lord manifesting and making
Himself visible is generally termed as His birth.
Many scriptures have references to the Lord being in the womb of
His mother (for example Krishna being in the womb of Devaki) before
being born. The Lord’s existence in the womb is incidental to the storyline

Chapter 2

where the Lord continues to exist with infinite auspicious attributes and His
condition is not like that of mortals who suffer in their mother’s womb.

which is caused by attachment. The soul does not have these defects
intrinsically, but a person gets them due to attachment. A wise person who
does not have such defects (avinashi) will know the true nature of
individual souls and the Supreme Soul and will know that no one can cause

that a soul experiences transformation in a physical body as a person
transitions through childhood, youth, adulthood, and old age. However, that
was related to the same physical body. In this verse, it is clarified that the
same soul will migrate from a decayed body to a new body, just as one
discards old, worn-out clothes and replaces them with new, good clothes.

Comments: While it was made clear that the intrinsic body of a soul
does not decay or get destroyed over time, some can question whether it
would be possible to harm or destroy a soul with physical elements such as
weapons (made from mining earth), fire, water, wind etc. In this verse it is
clarified that it is not possible to harm or destroy a soul by any of these
means. Further, as clarified by Sri Rayaru [GV], it is also not possible to
destroy a soul through a curse (as in the episode of Daksha Prajapati
having his head chopped off due to a curse, there was no destruction of his
soul).

Comments: The previous verse indicated that the Lord is
omnipresent. If so, and if the Lord is resident in all beings, then why is He
not visible? This verse answers this question by stating that no one can

contradictory attributes.

that the loss of the physical bodies of dear ones can also cause grief, as he
would not be able to see them. Verse 2.27 answers this question by stating
that birth and death of physical bodies is inevitable for everyone and there
is no point in grieving over this issue that has no solution.

O Bharata! Living beings get a body between birth and death from

death. Why grieve over such a body? (2.28)

52

The Bhagavad Gita

Comments: While it was made clear that everyone experiences birth
and death due to their physical bodies, what causes birth and death? This
verse reveals that birth and death are caused by interaction with material
nature. The physical body is made up of a certain proportion of the five
basic elements of nature. When a soul gets a body from material nature it is
termed as birth, and when it loses the body and is back to material nature, it
is termed as death. A soul that is dependent on the Lord has no control over
the process of birth and death. So, it is not worth grieving over such a
temporary body.
After conquering the snake Kalinga, Krishna and other yadavas were
spending a night in the forest. They were faced with the onset of rapidly
approaching forest fire. Lord Krishna extinguished this fire by swallowing
it. Saint Sri Vadiraja [RV] describes this incident to explain the fact that all
elements of nature emanate from the Lord and submerge back into Him.

Comments: While it was made clear previously that individual souls
are not independent, one can ask who they are dependent on. This verse
explains that the sole independent entity in the universe is the Lord
Almighty. It also answers that there are no other independent entities that
can equal the Lord. While many people can claim to know the attributes of
the Lord, this verse makes it clear that only some visualize the Lord with
amazement. Just as one cannot find any comparison to the sky or the ocean,
no one can find any comparison to the Lord. He is truly incomparable. For
one to get over grief that may arise from any activity, one must focus on
performing one’s duty as an offering to the Lord. So, it is important for one
to appreciate the true greatness of the Lord.

O Bharata! The soul inside the physical body cannot be destroyed
even if the physical body perishes (as it is protected by the Lord). So, there
is no need to grieve over anyone. (2.30)
Comments: In verse 2.12, it was stated that the individual souls are
also by their nature eternal. How then can one say that they are dependent
on the Lord? Sri Rayaru [GV] explains that the Lord protects and controls
all bodies that envelope an individual soul, namely – the intrinsic body
(swaroopa deha), the subtle body (linga deha) and the gross physical body
(sthoola deha). This verse thus explains another aspect of the Lord’s
greatness.

Comments: In verse 1.29, Arjuna had said that he was trembling as
he was overcome with grief. In this verse, the Lord responds to that
condition. Previously He had declared that Arjuna need not grieve over the
loss of near and dear ones as their souls never perish. Now Krishna says
that in addition, it is Arjuna’s compulsory duty to fight the Kauravas to end
their misrule and there is nothing more important than this. Thus, there is
absolutely no need for Arjuna to feel weak and helpless.

fear of losing. Krishna says that Arjuna was held in high esteem as a great
warrior based on his winning many battles, and other great warriors can
now conclude that Arjuna ran away from the war as he was afraid of facing
them. After all, many other participants in this war (on both sides) would

whether it was better for the Pandavas to win the war or for the Kauravas to
win. Krishna responds to that doubt here. After discussing the impact on
Arjuna’s reputation for backing away from a just war, Krishna now goes on
to convince him that he is in a win-win situation and has nothing to lose by
fighting the war. If Arjuna were to win this war, he would get back the
kingdom and reach heavens hereafter for adhering to his duties. If he were
to lose the war and die, he would surely reach the heavens for his efforts in
fighting the evil. Either way, he wins.

answers that point by stating that performing one’s prescribed duty as an
offering to the Lord will not attract sins and in fact will help accrue positive
credit. One must treat with equanimity - happiness and sadness, profit,
loss, victory and defeat in all actions and perform them as offerings to the
Lord. Arjuna must get over any sadness due to the loss of near and dear
ones and focus on performing his duty.

Comments: From verses 2.12 to 2.38, Krishna gives Arjuna
knowledge (sankhya) about the Lord and the individual souls. From now
on, He teaches Arjuna the methods and procedures of acquiring such
knowledge after which Arjuna would be able to perform his prescribed
duties with conviction, realize the Lord, get over worldly bondage and
achieve the state of eternal bliss (moksha). While previous verses discussed
the nature of individual souls and briefly, the nature of the Supreme Lord,
from now on till the end of Chapter 6, more details about the methods and
procedures to learn about the nature of the Lord are provided. Also, so far,
Krishna had addressed Arjuna’s specific situation, and from now on, the
teachings would turn generic in that they would apply to the whole of
mankind.

about the efforts required to achieve spiritual knowledge. Given the
significant efforts required, what would happen if one could not complete
the task? The Lord states that no effort is wasted. Even if someone starts
the process and for some reason gets interrupted, the efforts will yield
positive results. Any sincere effort will please the Lord and through His
grace one will be able to achieve spiritual awakening.

O Scion of the Kuru Dynasty (Arjuna)! There is only one teaching
that leads to decisive spiritual knowledge. There are endless teachings that
lead the undecided ones to diverse, wrong knowledge. (2.41)
Comments: There are different teachings (often contradictory) about
spiritual knowledge. How then does one know the true path? Krishna in
this verse categorically states that only true teaching leads to proper divine
and spiritual knowledge. This is based on evidence from revered spiritual
texts such as the Vedas and is realized from following the Vaishnava path
which enunciates the supremacy of Lord Vishnu as the supreme of all
souls. In the next few verses (from 2.41 to 2.46), the Lord clears any doubts
about the true purport of the Vedas.
It is interesting to note that the Lord refers to Arjuna as
Kurunandana, meaning ‘Scion of the Kuru dynasty who would bring joy to
his lineage’, probably implying that most of the descendants of the Kuru
dynasty such as Duryodhana and his 99 brothers belong to the type of
people who believe in various, wrong teachings. Arjuna is different and can
dispel his doubts and regain the spiritual knowledge he had already
possessed.

O Partha! Those with peripheral knowledge of the Vedas say that
attaining heavens is the only goal of following the Vedas, ignoring the
lofty goal of liberation (moksha). They only focus on temporary worldly
riches and pleasures and believe that they are the end goals of conducting
Vedic rituals. (2.42) (2.43)

Chapter 2

Comments: As the Vedas can be interpreted in multiple ways, many
focus only on the peripheral interpretation and conclude that the Vedic
texts teach only rituals to appease lesser deities, which would result in
achieving desired riches and materialistic happiness in this lifetime and
enjoying heavenly fruits hereafter. Krishna categorically speaks against this
viewpoint and strongly advises that the real purport of the Vedas is to help
one achieve liberation, the state of everlasting, pure and complete bliss
(Moksha), and not riches and heavens which are temporary. Using the
Vedas only to reach the heavens would be like plucking a flower from a
tree, without waiting for the flower to fully transform into a fruit (which
represents Moksha).

performing Vedic rituals with sincerity? After all these fruits have been
earned using legitimate, moral means as enunciated in the Vedas. Lord
Krishna responds by saying that indulgence in such temporary pleasures
will focus their minds only on material issues and their minds will not be
able meditate on the Lord. Concentrated meditation is required to gain
proper spiritual knowledge.

The Bhagavad Gita

O Arjuna! Peripherally the Vedas appear to describe rituals that
result in attainment of heavenly and worldly fruits made up of the three
attributes. Do not aspire for these. Go beyond dualities (such as pleasure
and pain). Focus your mind on the Lord Almighty and leave it to the Lord
to help you attain your goals and to help you protect goals already attained.
(2.45)
Comments: The Lord continues to teach about the real purport of
the Vedas. In this verse, the Lord instructs that one should not focus on the
peripheral meaning of the Vedas that appear to provide details of rituals to
help achieve worldly fruits. These fruits and even heavens that one may
achieve are borne out of material nature which is a mixture of three
attributes – sat, rajas and tamas. As such, these are not permanent, and
even if one reaches the heavens, one is bound to fall back to earth after
expending merits from good deeds. One should detach oneself from yoga
(striving for proscribed material entities not already owned) and kshema
(protecting proscribed material entities already possessed). The real purport
of the Vedas is to describe the nature of the Lord Almighty. One should
focus on the Lord who will help one achieve everlasting bliss (nirvana).

The benefit derived from a small body of water such as a well is
better derived from a sumptuous water body such as an ocean. Likewise,
benefits derived from following Vedic rituals with proper meaning are
surely available for one with special knowledge who has realized the Lord
Almighty. (2.46)
Comments: In the previous verses, it was indicated that the real
purport of the Vedas is in understanding of the Lord and not in transient
material benefits including attaining the heavens. It was made clear that one
who goes by the peripheral meaning of the Vedas and performs rituals only
to attain transient material benefits will never achieve everlasting bliss. A

Chapter 2

61

question arises as to whether the seeker who goes by the inner meaning of
the Vedas and realizes the Lord will be eligible for transient fruits such as
the heavens. This verse answers that question through an example. Just as
the benefits available from well water are available from a larger body of
water such as a lake or an ocean, one who has realized the Lord by proper
understanding of the Vedas will surely achieve transient benefits such as
heavens, even when one is not focused on them.
Sri Raghavendra Swamy in his Gita Vivruti [GV] provides an
explanation for the words brahmana (one who has realized the Lord) and
vijanatha (one who has special knowledge) where both appear to mean the
same thing. Sri Rayaru says that vijanatha indicates the one who has
paroksha (or indirect) knowledge of the Lord and brahmana indicates one
who has gone a step further and has realized aparoksha or direct
knowledge of the Lord. In that sense, for one to obtain direct knowledge of
the Lord, one must first start by learning the knowledge indirectly (through
a qualified teacher, studying Vedic scriptures etc.).
Sri Rayaru provides a second meaning for this verse, by interpreting
the Sanskrit terms samplutodaka and udapana differently. Earlier
samplutodaka referred to a large body of water (ex: an ocean) and udapana
referred to a small body of water (ex: well). Sri Rayaru provides a second
meaning for these terms. Samplutodaka means the ocean that dissolves the
universe during the grand dissolution and udapana refers to the Lord
Almighty who protects the eternal entities in the universe such as souls,
time etc. With this interpretation, the verse can also be translated to mean
as follows: Whatever advantage (such as dharma, moksha etc.) is obtained
through the Grace of the Lord Almighty who protects everything during
the great dissolution of the universe, the same advantage will be accrued by
a seeker who has realized the Lord through proper interpretation of the
Vedas.

You only have the right to do your duty, and never to its fruits.
Never perform your duties with expectations of outcomes. At the same
time, never think about relinquishing your duties. (2.47)
Comments: This is probably the most commented upon verse in the
Gita. It answers the question as to the purpose of performing ones’
prescribed duties when there is no guarantee of getting expected results.
Even if someone does not see any immediate material benefits from
performing ones’ prescribed duties, such actions will please the Lord. They
will result in one obtaining true knowledge about the Lord and eventually
achieving everlasting bliss. This is implied in the first line of this verse.
Another question that one can raise is the purpose of someone performing
any action at all, as earlier in verse 2.45, it was stated that one should
always focus ones mind on the Lord. The second line of this verse answers
this question by stating that in addition to focusing the mind on the Lord,
one must perform prescribed duties; otherwise, one will accrue sins due to
relinquishing of duties. In addition to the philosophical reasons, we can all
appreciate the fact that for a society to function smoothly, every one of us
must play our assigned roles with diligence and sincerity. Such activities,
especially when performed as an offering to the Lord, will help us receive
the Lord’s grace to help us in our spiritual journey. Lord Krishna is
instructing Arjuna here that he should not shirk from his prescribed duty of
fighting for a just cause, just because he is uncomfortable with the thought
of losing his loved ones.
Sri Rayaru [GV] also provides a second meaning for this verse. He
translates the phrase ‘karma phala hetu’ (the entity responsible to grant
fruits for actions) as the Lord Almighty, as He alone can grant someone the
fruits. As per verse 2.45, one should not consider oneself identical to the

Chapter 2

63

Lord as the Lord is supreme and He alone can grant one’s wishes. The
second interpretation of this verse is as follows: Arjuna! Individual souls
can only perform prescribed duties. They do not have the ability to obtain
the fruits by themselves. That ability is only with the Lord. Individual souls
are quite different and are subservient to the Lord and hence one should
never consider oneself as the Lord.
Sri Rayaru [GV] also provides convincing responses to many other
deep, philosophical questions in his interpretation of this verse. Following
is the summary:
 Even those who have already realized the Lord have to keep
performing duties.
 For one who has already realized the Lord, any additional credit
from performing duties will result in buoyant happiness in moksha
(the level of bliss in moksha is dependent on the innate capabilities
of souls, but additional credits will result in buoyant happiness, just
like when milk boils over, the amount of milk does not change but
the milk exhibits more buoyancy)
 No one is exempt from performing one’s prescribed duties
 While this verse indicates that one should not perform duties with an
expectation of the outcome, it is not prohibited for someone to
perform activities with loftier expectations of spiritual knowledge
and the Lord’s Grace. One should avoid expectations of temporary,
transient, material fruits.
 Although phrases such as ‘swarga kamo yajeta’ prescribe rituals for
fulfilment of mundane desires, the scriptures do not mandate such
actions for fulfilment of desires.
 Major distinction between individual beings and the Lord in the
context of duties and fruits:
- Individual Beings: Have responsibility to perform duties. Cannot
grant wishes.
- Lord Almighty: Has no prescribed responsibility. Can grant
wishes.

O Dhananjaya! On your spiritual path (yoga), perform duties without
attachments and expectations of results. The real yoga is performing one’s
duties without expectations and with equanimity. (2.48)
Comments: From verses 2.48 onwards, the Lord provides more
details on the concept of nishkama karma (performing prescribed duties
without expectations). In the previous verse 2.47, the Lord instructs Arjuna
never to think of relinquishing prescribed duties. This verse responds to the
question as to how one should perform prescribed duties. Yoga is having no
expectations of results from duties performed and being equanimous to
positive or negative outcomes. These are not two separate definitions of
yoga.
Sri Vidyasagara Madhava Teertha has provided a detailed
description of a yogi identified in this verse as –
(i) one whose mind and intellect are transfixed at the feet of the Lord
with the knowledge of the Lord’s omnipresence, omnipotence, and
omniscience.
(ii) one who engages in actions without attachment to the act itself or
the fruits of such actions.
(iii) one who engages in all activities only to please the Lord and as a
service to the Lord.
(iv) one who, knowing fully well that everything is at the will and
command of the Lord, accepts success or failure with equanimity.

O Dhananjaya! Performing duties with expectation of the outcome is
very inferior to the task of attaining divine spiritual knowledge. Wretched
are those whose motive is fruit of the action. Focus your mind on spiritual
knowledge. (2.49)
Comments: In 2.46, it was indicated that one should avoid
performing Vedic rituals for temporary gains but instead focus on the inner
meaning of the Vedas to attain proper spiritual knowledge. In that sense,
performing duties with expectation of material outcome is inferior to the
task of attaining divine knowledge. This verse answers the question as to
the reason for this distinction. One who is focused only on activities
yielding temporary gains will realize sooner or later that such gains will not
last and will start feeling miserable. Hence there is no point in performing
activities with such expectations.
Sri Rayaru [GV] also provides an alternate interpretation for the
second half of this verse in response to a question as to whether someone
who has already attained spiritual knowledge can consider himself as one
with the Lord. By interpreting the phrase phala hetava (the one who grants
wishes) as referring to the Lord, Sri Rayaru says that even those who have
attained spiritual knowledge will not claim identity with the Lord as such a
claim would lead to unending misery.

activities performed with expectations of material gains are inferior to the
activities pursued in attaining divine knowledge.

66

The Bhagavad Gita

That technique which steers one clear of worldly entanglement and
ushers one towards the transcendental is ‘skill in action’ (karmasu
kauśalam). In this verse, some of the special advantages of these superior
activities are outlined. It is indicated that one who has realized the Lord
will be rid of the consequences of good and bad deeds which is the
essential last step in achieving moksha. A question that would arise
naturally is about the reason for consequences of even good deeds to be
nullified. Sri Rayaru in GV provides an answer. Good deeds are of two
kinds – first one that leads to more clarity on divine knowledge and more
exuberant happiness in moksha (ishta punya), and second ones (anishta
punya) that do not. Credits from good deeds of the second kind must be
used up in this world (in current or future births) while credits from the first
kind of good deed will be carried forward till one achieves moksha. The
Lord categorically states that among all activities, those that lead to
attainment of divine knowledge are supreme.
Sri Rayaru [GV] provides a second interpretation for the second half
of this verse. One can ask the question - If one feels that one can put in all
required efforts to attain spiritual knowledge (which is the goal for
achieving moksha), why should one perform activities without expectations
on material outcomes? Sri Rayaru answers saying that only activities that
are performed for the sole purpose of pleasing the Lord and obtaining
divine knowledge will lead to moksha.
Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha Swamiji in his Gita Saroddhara [BGS]
indicates that this verse reflects the summary of entire chapter 2. This is
very appropriate as in this chapter Arjuna in verses 2.4 to 2.8 had expressed
the conflict in his mind about his course of action and requested Krishna
for guidance. Krishna categorically states in this verse that one needs to
perform ones prescribed duty with the goal of achieving divine, spiritual
knowledge and that Arjuna needs to engage himself in fighting this holy
war to protect his citizens.

The wise who have learnt about the supremacy of the Lord

Comments: In this verse, the Lord provides additional benefits of
obtaining proper spiritual knowledge (aparoksha jnana = direct, divine
knowledge) which results in attaining moksha. One who reaches moksha
will not only be devoid of sadness or blemishes but will also permanently
escape the cycle of births and deaths. Lord Krishna is emphasizing the
permanence of moksha as opposed to the transitory benefits of heavens. Sri
Rayaru in GV explains the reason for interpreting the word ‘manīṣiṇaḥ’ as
the one with direct, divine knowledge (aparoksha jnana). The word
‘manīṣi’ means incredibly special knowledge, and direct divine knowledge
certainly qualifies for this description.

teachings yet to be delivered. One must first cleanse one’s mind of ignorant

The Bhagavad Gita

Once you develop conviction in spiritual teachings, your mind will
become steadfast. At that time, you will be able to follow the path of divine
knowledge. (2.53)
Comments: In 2.52, it was indicated that one must rid oneself of
ignorant viewpoints. In this verse, the questions about what ignorant
viewpoints really are and how one could be rid of them are answered.
Ignorant viewpoints are those that are not supported by authentic scriptures
such as the Vedas. Ones who have developed strong conviction about
teachings from scriptures such as the Vedas will be able to rid themselves
of ignorant viewpoints without any doubt. They will then be ready to focus
their minds on the Lord which will lead to eternal bliss through the grace of
the Lord.
Sri Rayaru [GV] provides a second interpretation of this verse based
on Sri Madhwacharya’s commentary in GTN where the phrase ‘shruti
vipratipanna’ is interpreted alternately as ‘shruti visheshena pratipanna’ to
mean – one with the right viewpoint based on authentic scriptures (shruti).
Based on this, the verse can be interpreted to mean the following – The one
who has realized the Lord based on proper understanding of the Vedas will
have one’s mind firmly placed on the Lord and will eventually attain
moksha through the Lord’s grace.

Arjuna said: O Keshava! What are the characteristics of a person

(Stita Prajna)? How does that person talk or sit or walk (in other words,
why does that person need to engage in any activity)? (2.54)

Chapter 2

69

Comments: This is perhaps one of the most widely quoted verse
from the Gita. After listening to the Lord’s teachings about the need for
one to perform prescribed duties without expectations, focusing the mind
on the Lord and related topics, Arjuna is now curious to know the
characteristics of a person who has developed unwavering conviction
(tranquil mind) in divine knowledge. It is interesting that he uses the term
‘bhasha’ to mean characteristics instead of the more common word
‘lakshana’. Arjuna, by using the term ‘samadhi’ (state of complete mental
concentration on the Lord), has himself defined a characteristic (lakshana)
of a person with deep conviction in divine knowledge. By using the word
‘bhasha’, Arjuna is enquiring about the characteristic of such a person
when that person is out of samadhi and is engaged in normal day to day
activities. References to talking, sitting, walking etc., in this verse here
imply normal day today activities. In other words, Arjuna wants to know
how the person with firm resolve performs day to day activities (when not
in state of samadhi).
Sri Rayaru [GV] also provides a second interpretation for this verse
as follows: Why does one who has achieved divine knowledge need to
perform activities such as talking, sitting, walking etc.? Here the word
‘kim’ is used to mean ‘why’. In that sense it is a rhetorical question. Why
should someone who has already achieved the state of samadhi and has
developed unwavering conviction in the Lord indulge in any mundane, day
to day worldly activities?
The Lord responds to Arjuna’s questions in the remaining verses of
this chapter which undoubtedly form the core teachings of the Gita.

The Bhagavad Gita

The Lord said: O Partha! One who has conquered mental blemishes
such as desire and has focused mind on the Lord Almighty will achieve
mental tranquility by the grace of the Lord. (2.55)
Comments: The Lord answers Arjuna’s question 2.54, from 2.55
onwards till the end of this chapter. For the rhetorical question in the
second line of 2.54, the Lord answers in verse 2.69. While desire is
mentioned as a blemish that one needs to conquer, this also applies to other
blemishes such as greed, anger, hatred etc. Note that desire here refers to
worldly desires and not lofty desires such as achieving divine knowledge.
Sri Rayaru [GV] explains the special reason for the use of the word
‘manogatan’ (mental) in this verse. Blemishes such as desire, greed, anger
etc., originate in the mind. That being the case, what is the reason for using
the qualifier ‘mental’ in ‘mental blemishes’? The divine knowledge that
one would attain by the grace of the Lord also manifests in the same mind.
For the same mind to attain divine knowledge, it is necessary to be rid of
worldly blemishes. It is to drive home the fact that divine knowledge also
resides in the same mind that the qualifier ‘mental’ is used in this verse.
In verse 2.39, the Lord started out saying that He would teach the
path (yoga) to obtain divine knowledge. However, in this verse, He is
teaching the characteristics of a yogi who has already attained divine
knowledge. How can this be reconciled? Sri Rayaru [GV] states that for a
seeker interested in traversing the path towards divine knowledge, it is
important to learn about the characteristics of yogis who have already
successfully traversed that path.

the characteristics of a person with mental tranquility. In 2.55, worldly

Comments: The reason for this equanimity in both pleasure and
discomfort in such a person is the lack of attachment to worldly issues.
The previous verse 2.56 identified the absence of anger as one of the
characteristics of a person with mental tranquility and this verse indicates
the absence of hatred during distress as another characteristic. Sri Jaya
Teertha in his PD clarifies that there is no repetition here as the absence of
hatred in 2.57 refers to all situations (due to the use of the word sarvatrāg)
including those where there may be reasons for such hatred.

By fasting, one can reduce the ability of one’s body to consume and
digest food, but not the cravings to indulge in tasty food. Those cravings
can only be diminished by realizing the Lord Almighty. (2.59)
Comments: The next 3 verses are about sense control. By practicing
self-discipline such as fasting, one experiences reduced power in the five
sense organs of perception such as eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin.
However, the craving experienced by the mind to indulge in sense
pleasures does not diminish. This can only happen when one experiences a
vision of Lord Almighty.
Sri Rayaru [GV] also provides an alternate meaning to this verse by
interpreting the word ‘rasa varjam’ to mean desires in objects of all
sensory pleasures except taste. This means that by fasting one may
experience loss of desire in the objects of sense pleasures such as sound,
form, smell, and touch but not in the sense object of taste. This can only be
overcome when one experiences a vision of Lord Almighty. This
interpretation is also consistent with practical experience as when one ages
and loses power and interest in seeing, listening, hearing etc., the desire to
taste good food never goes away. In summary, a seeker should strive to
achieve control over all sense organs and mind.

O Son of Kunti! It is the nature of sense organs to get attracted to

Comments: If one can understand that one needs to control one’s
sense organs from indulging in sense pleasures (discipline in consumption -

Chapter 2

73

pratyahara) and focus one’s minds on attaining spiritual knowledge, one
may be able to conquer their sense organs. In that case why should one
undertake difficult activities such as fasting - nirahara etc.? This verse
answers this question by stating that sense organs are extremely strong and
can exert control on the minds of even learned ones. It is the nature of sense
organs to cause turbulence in one’s mind. Hence, one must undertake
difficult rituals such as fasting on special days etc., in addition to spiritual
studies and try to overcome the influence of sense organs on one’s mind.
The sense organs and the mind are inert objects. A question then
arises as to how these inert objects can exert such control over each other.
One must remember that the sense organs, while inert, are activated by the
Lord resident in every soul based on the innate nature of that soul. So, it is
the responsibility of the individual soul to try and control the activities of
the sense organs.

One should control one’s sense organs from indulgence with a firm

Comments: From previous discussions, it appears that one needs to
control one’s sense organs to attain divine, spiritual knowledge. However,
it also appears that one needs to have possessed such divine, spiritual
knowledge to be permanently free from the control of sense organs. This
appears to be a circular argument and hence is logically untenable
(anyonyashraya dosha). How can this be reconciled? Sri Rayaru [GV]
points to this verse for the answer. One must try and control one’s sense
organs while at the same time focus mind on the Supreme Lord. This will
allow the mind to move towards concentrated meditation (dhyana) which
allows one to undertake difficult sense control tasks such as strict fasting,

74

The Bhagavad Gita

and eventually conquer the sense organs. Such a person is now ready to
absorb divine, spiritual knowledge paving the way for moksha.
Sri Rayaru [GV] clarifies that for one to achieve divine, spiritual
knowledge (aparoksha jnana), in addition to achieving full control over the
sense organs, a seeker also needs to conquer emotions such as desire,
hatred etc., as described later in verse 2.64.

One who keeps contemplating on sense pleasures develops an
attachment and obsession with them, which leads to desire in experiencing
such pleasures. This desire in turn leads to anger in the event of not being
able to satisfy these desires. Anger leads to delusion and clouds one’s mind
about right and wrong. This delusion leads one to forget injunctions against
forbidden activities. This forgetfulness in turn leads to failure in intellectual
judgement. Loss of intellect results in one’s downfall. (2.62) (2.63)
Comments: In verse 2.63, it was stated that one should focus ones
mind on the Lord while striving to achieve self-control to conquer the sense
organs. In verses 2.62, 2.63, 2.64, the Lord outlines the chain reaction that
would ensue from loss of self-control and the emotional impact of
attachment/aversion or likes/dislikes (raga/dvesha) leading to ones
downfall (and eventual fall into hell). Understanding of this chain reaction
will help one to develop equanimity in likes and dislikes.
The chain reaction is as follows: contemplation on sense pleasures ->
obsession -> desire -> anger -> delusion -> forgetfulness -> loss of

Chapter 2

75

intellect -> destruction. Forgetfulness could be of two types. One would be
forgetting knowledge about avoiding activities prohibited in the scriptures
and the other would be to forget societal norms such as not usurping
properties owned by others. As indicated in 2.56, one who has realized the
Lord will have conquered these emotions, but a seeker on the spiritual path
will have to strive to control these emotions, or else he/she will experience
the state indicated in the chain reaction. The primary cause of the chain
reaction is the inability to manage raga, and dvesha. This aspect is further
explained in the next verse.

One, whose sense organs are under control and are not perturbed by
the effects of likes/dislikes, attachment/hatred, will partake in just enough
sense indulgence for physical health and, through self-control will
experience peace of mind. (2.64),
One whose mind is at peace will quickly absorb divine, spiritual
knowledge (aparoksha jnana). Then, such a person will be rid of all
miseries. This concept is well known through the scriptures. (2.65)
Comments: These two verses indicate the benefits one would accrue
by controlling the emotions of likes and dislikes. The benefits are – victory
over sense organs and mental peace. In 2.61, it was indicated that one who
has conquered sense organs will attain direct, divine (aparoksha)
knowledge. However, sense control itself will not directly lead to
attainment of divine knowledge. Sense control leads to mental peace
allowing one to practice concentrated meditation. This leads to attaining
direct, divine knowledge. So the immediate advantage of self-control is
mental peace which eventually leads to direct, divine knowledge in a serial

76

The Bhagavad Gita

manner. It is also clarified that one who has achieved control over sense
organs can indulge in sense activities just enough to maintain physical
wellbeing. In verse 2.59, it was indicated that one would need to undertake
difficult tasks such as fasting to achieve self-control. Here it is clarified that
one does not need to completely avoid consuming foods as one has to
ensure physical wellbeing. It is possible to indulge in activities such as
consuming minimum amount of required food while still exerting control
over the sense organs.
In summary, the sequence of events that would unfold from
achieving self-control are as follows: Self-control (over sense organs) ->
mental peace -> concentrated meditation -> divine knowledge ->
elimination of sadness (due to evisceration of sins) -> liberation.

One who does not have control over the mind cannot absorb spiritual
knowledge. Such a person also cannot meditate peacefully. How can one
achieve liberation without meditation? How can one enjoy bliss without
liberation? (2.66)
Comments: The next two verses describe the perils of not being able
to control one’s mind. If one can achieve divine, spiritual knowledge
through scriptural studies and analysis, why would one need to control ones
mind? This verse answers by stating that one who does not control the
mind will not be able to practice concentrated meditation without which
one will not be able to absorb difficult concepts in the scriptures. Also, in
this verse it is stated that one who does not achieve liberation (moksha)
cannot enjoy bliss. One can question the reason for explicitly stating that
eternal bliss can only be enjoyed by those in moksha. It must be noted that
in 2.65, it was stated that when one is liberated, one will be rid of
unhappiness. This verse clarifies that in moksha not only will one be rid of
misery, but one will also enjoy pure bliss.

The mind which follows sense organs that go after sense pleasures
will be swayed just like a ship gets swayed in an ocean by strong winds.
This leads to loss of intellectual judgement and also knowledge derived
through studies. (2.67)
Comments: This verse makes it very clear that even one who has
learnt a lot through study of scriptures and contemplation of scriptural
concepts will not be able to benefit from such knowledge if one is unable to
control the mind and the sense organs. Mere acquisition of scriptural
knowledge without exercising control over the senses and the mind
amounts to just book knowledge.The mind is easily swayed. If sense organs
pursue sense pleasures, the mind will follow them and will sway just like a
boat in an ocean and loses direction when faced with strong winds.
The example of a ship getting swayed by strong winds brings to
memory an episode in the life of Sri Madhwacharya. Acharya was once
meditating on the seashore near Udupi when he saw a ship caught in a
violent storm. The people on the ship were crying for help. Acharya waved
his holy fabric (kavi shati) towards the ship, at which the ship immediately
stabilized on the waters and came safely ashore. The travelers on the ship
who were rescued by Acharya were very grateful and offered him precious
gems on board the ship, but Acharya was content with just a lump of
sandstone (gopi chandana) that was used to tie the ship’s mast. Inside the
sandstone was a beautiful idol of Sri Krishna which was worshipped by
Goddess Rukmini and Lord Brahma. Sri Madhwacharya carried that idol
and installed it in Udupi where it can be seen even today! We can see the
relevance of using the example of a ship swaying in the ocean in this verse
considering this episode. Our body is like a ship that we are using to cross
the ocean of samsara. Inside our body, Lord Krishna resides in our hearts
just like the idol of Sri Krishna was inside the sandstone. Just as the

78

The Bhagavad Gita

travelers on the ship did not know the value of the sandstone piece which
had the idol of Sri Krishna in it, we too do not appreciate the presence of
the Lord in our hearts. Just as the travelers on the ship faced violent
turbulence due to strong winds, we also feel great perturbance in our minds
due to strong swaying of our sense organs. The travelers saw Sri
Madhwacharya and cried for help. Acharya rescued them immediately.
Similarly, if we turn to Sri Madhwacharya (an incarnation of Sri Vayudeva)
asking for help in traversing this ocean of samsara, he will rescue us and
land us safely in moksha.

Comments: In the 4 verses, starting from verse 2.55 to 2.58, the
Lord described the characteristics of a person with mental tranquility. In the
9 verses from 2.59 to 2.67, questions about the nature of such a person
were answered. This verse is a concluding summary of the above 9 verses.
The sequence of stages for such a person to achieve divine, spiritual
knowledge are sense-control -> peace of mind -> mental concentration ->

On the issue of spiritual knowledge where everyone is in the dark, a

everyone is wide awake (and fully engaged), the realized soul stays in the

Chapter 2

79

Comments: In this verse the Lord is comparing the interests and
knowledge of a normal worldly person and a realized person. Most people
immersed in daily, worldly affairs are completely in the dark and have no
interest in learning about the attributes of the Lord, whereas a realized soul
is very much alert, awake, and aware of the attributes of the Lord.
Conversely, while most people are focused on worldly matters, indulging in
sense pleasure, a realized person stays in the dark (has no interest in such
matters).
A realized soul is completely immersed in the Lord and has no
interest at all in worldly matters. A question then arises about deities such
as Indra, Surya, Agni etc., who are realized souls but have an active role in
worldly matters as they activate the sense organs of living beings. If, as
realized souls, they avoid taking interest in worldly matters, how can the
world function? Sri Rayaru [GV] answers this question by stating that the
nature of a realized soul referred to in this verse does not apply to deities. It
applies to souls who have achieved self-realization but are not part of the
group of deities who have specific roles.

Just as an ocean does not rise with constant inflow of water and

without getting attached is destined for liberation. One who is always
focused on chasing desires can never achieve peace. (2.70)
Comments: It was stated in verse 2.69 that a realized person has no
interest in worldly matters. However, there are instances of such people
indulging in sense activities such as eating, hearing, seeing etc. This verse
explains this apparent contradiction by clarifying that just as an ocean does
not rise with the inflow of river waters, a realized person who indulges in
sense activities, purely to maintain physical wellbeing, does not get
attached to such consumption.

when partaking in such consumption, one should do so with detachment

Comments: In verses 2.55 to 2.69, the Lord explains the
characteristics of a realized soul in response to Arjuna’s query in verse
2.54. This verse is a conclusion of that discussion. Sri Rayaru clarifies in
GV that a realized soul will reach the Lord’s abode only after getting rid of
the effects of good and bad deeds (prarabdha karma). Sri Rayaru further
clarifies that the reference to Brahma here is related to the Lord (Para
Brahma) and not to the four-faced deity Brahma, based on the use of the
qualifier nirvana (meaning one without material body = Lord Almighty as
vana = bana refers to material body).
Summary of Chapter 2
With the context for the teachings in the Gita established in Chapter
1, the actual sermon of Lord Krishna to Arjuna (and through Arjuna to the

Chapter 2

81

rest of humanity) begins in Chapter 2. Seeing Arjuna in a pitiable condition
not wanting to wage the war, Krishna asks Arjuna why he wants to avoid
performing his prescribed duties and thereby risk losing respect in society.
Such an abdication of responsibility is not worthy of a great prince like
Arjuna who had a stellar reputation for fighting for justice all his life
(2.2-2.3). Arjuna, who so far wanted to avoid war out of compassion and
attachment to his kith and kin, now reasons that Bheeshma, Drona and
others are not mere family members and teachers whom he holds in very
high esteem. They are also worthy of worship. However, Krishna’s
questioning opens some doubts in his mind, and he informs Krishna that his
mind is conflicted, and he is unsure about the path forward. He surrenders
to Krishna, requests to be considered as a student and given guidance
(2.4-2.8). Given that Arjuna’s doubts are deep rooted, Lord Krishna
proceeds to deliver a very detailed sermon to him covering all aspects of
life such as the relationship between the Lord and individual souls,
responsibilities of everyone in society, concept of devotion to the Lord,
transient nature of life, cycle of births and deaths and many more topics
which prove to be a summary of critical teachings from all scriptures such
as the Vedas and great epics such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata etc
(2.11-2.71).
At this stage, one can expect several questions as to the context and
content of the Gita. Firstly, why would Krishna get into great details about
life, the universe, the relationship between the Lord and individual souls
and such spiritual issues when all that was needed was some timely,
practical advice to Arjuna to get on with fighting the war. The reason
Krishna had to get into such great details is that Arjuna had developed deep
rooted doubts about his duties and responsibilities, and he had to be
convinced about the need to perform his duties without getting excessively
attached to his near and dear ones. Secondly, one would wonder if the
battlefield was the right venue for such heavy philosophical discourse
which should normally occur in a serene, quiet environment. Again, it is
normal for many to seek guidance when they come to a crossroad and are
about to implement actions with grave repercussions. These are the very
times when one needs proper spiritual guidance. Some would question as to

82

The Bhagavad Gita

how such a lengthy sermon can be delivered when millions of soldiers are
about to start a war. Krishna’s conversation with Arjuna runs quickly as
Arjuna is an evolved soul and absorbs the concepts very quickly. Finally,
some wonder how Arjuna who is known as an incarnation of deity Indra
could be ignorant and develop such fundamental doubts about his duties
and responsibilities. At the end of Krishna’s teachings, Arjuna responds
saying that by Krishna’s grace, his doubts have been cleared, his memory is
back, and he is clear about his duties and responsibilities (18.73). The fact
that his memory was back, implies that Arjuna had proper knowledge about
his duties earlier but for some reason his mind was covered with delusion.
It was the Lord’s Divine Will that Arjuna would undergo temporary loss of
memory to set the stage for his doubts and questions, which then gave Him
an opportunity to use Arjuna as an instrument to teach the Gita to all of the
mankind. Lord Krishna then advances many powerful reasons for Arjuna to
stop worrying about the harm the war could cause to his loved ones.
Firstly, his elders and teachers such as Bheeshma and Drona were not
worthy of grieving for as they had supported Duryodhana, the evil king,
whose army had to be destroyed to establish order and righteousness.
Despite their good nature, these elders were blind to Duryodhana’s evil
intentions and hence were not deserving of sympathy (2.11). Secondly, if
Arjuna was worried that these elders would be permanently destroyed,
Krishna reminds him that the body and the soul are separate, and that their
souls would live on. Further, based on the good deeds they had performed,
they would achieve heaven. So, it was unnecessary to grieve over them
(2.12). Thirdly, just as a body undergoes various stages in life such as
childhood, youth, old age etc, death is also a natural stage for everybody.
As such, these elders would die one day or the other, and no amount of
grieving could prevent that (2.13). Fourthly, just as one does not grieve
about throwing out old, worn-out clothes as they are replaced by new, good
clothes, one should not grieve over a worn-out body that will eventually be
replaced by a new one (2.22). Basically, Krishna teaches Arjuna that he
must perform his rightful duties and any excuses coming in the way are
untenable.

Chapter 2

83

Verses 2.20 to 2.24 give us a description of the nature of individual
souls which are indestructible, and have no beginning or end etc. As
opposed to individual souls, the nature of the Supreme Soul (Lord
Almighty) is briefly described in verses 2.17, 2.25 and 2.29. The Lord who
pervades everywhere, is eternal, and does not experience destruction of the
body (as His body is transcendental), and is full of auspicious attributes and
is devoid of any blemishes. He is superior to individual souls and hence is
worthy of worship. One should perform ones prescribed duties as an
offering to the Lord without expectations. This paves the way for one’s
liberation. Coming to the practical aspects of Arjuna’s decision to
relinquish arms, the Lord emphasizes the need for Arjuna to perform his
prescribed duties, as for a kshatriya, there is no loftier duty than waging a
just war. Arjuna has been handed a great opportunity to perform his duty
and he should not waste this chance. If he were to withdraw from war,
purely out of compassion to near and dear ones, nothing would prevent his
enemies from concluding that Arjuna was afraid to fight, and they could
question his valor. Finally, Krishna tells Arjuna that he has nothing to lose
by waging the war. If he wins, he gets to rule the kingdom and eventually
goes to heaven hereafter for diligently performing his duty. If he loses and
dies, he will attain heavens for his conviction and efforts (2.31-2.37). From
verses 2.12 to 2.38, Krishna imparts Arjuna knowledge (sankhya) about the
Lord and individual souls. From verse 2.39 onwards, He teaches Arjuna the
methods and procedure (yoga) for acquiring such knowledge after which
Arjuna would be able to perform his prescribed duties with conviction,
realize the Lord, get over worldly bondage and achieve the state of eternal
bliss (moksha). In verses 2.42 -2.45, the Lord teaches Arjuna the real
purport of the Vedas - that one should focus on the deeper meanings and
not get carried away by peripheral meanings. The real purport of the Vedas
is divine, spiritual knowledge of Lord Almighty. In verses 2.45-2.51, the
Lord discusses the concept of nishkama karma, that is performing
prescribed duties without expectations. Specifically, in verse 2.50, the Lord
categorically states that the best path for one to achieve divine, spiritual
knowledge is for one to focus on performing one’s assigned duties as an
offering to the Lord without expectations on the outcome (nishkama

84

The Bhagavad Gita

karma). Such a realized soul would be rid of the consequences of good and
bad deeds and would be eligible for liberation. Among all activities, those
that lead to attainment of divine knowledge is supreme. In verses 2.52 and
2.53, it is stated that in order to absorb proper teachings, one needs to
cleanse one’s mind of conflicting, ignorant, and inconsistent viewpoints not
based on scriptural truths. In verse 2.54, Arjuna asks Krishna about the
characteristics of a person with such a tranquil mind. In the 4 verses,
starting from verse 2.55 to 2.58, the Lord describes the characteristics of a
person with mental tranquility. In the 9 verses from 2.59 to 2.67, questions
about the nature of such a person are answered. The Lord concludes the
sermon in Chapter 2 by stating in 2.72 that such a person will not
experience worldly miseries and in due course will reach His abode.

Chapter 3 – The Path of Action
Chapter Introduction: This Chapter of 43 verses is termed Karma
Yoga (The Path of Action). In this chapter, the Lord answers Arjuna’s
questions regarding the paths of duty (karma) and knowledge (jnana).
Arjuna wonders if there was a way, he could focus on acquiring knowledge
(jnana) and avoid participating in the war. The Lord answers all Arjuna’s
doubts logically to convince him that everyone has an obligation to perform
his duties to society, and as a kshatriya prince it was Arjuna’s
responsibility to fight the just war to protect his citizens. To perform one’s
duty, one also needs to be equipped with knowledge and in that sense, one
needs to incorporate both karma and jnana in their spiritual journey. Based
on ones innate nature, some may be prescribed a path that is dominant in
action and others may be prescribed a path dominant in knowledge. This
chapter also has an excellent discussion on the Cyclic Order of the
Universe. In the previous chapter, in verses 2.12 to 2.30, the Lord lectured
on the nature of individual souls and the Supreme Soul (Lord Almighty). In
verse 2.39, the Lord tells Arjuna how to acquire spiritual knowledge which
would guide one to perform right actions. In the verses 2.45 to 2.51, the
Lord discusses the concept of nishkama karma (performing prescribed
duties without expectations) which would liberate one from bondage. In
this chapter, that concept is expanded in response to Arjuna’s questions that
appear in verses 3.1 and 3.2. Thus, chapter 3 is an appropriate follow up to
chapter 2.

Arjuna said: O Janardana! O Keshava! If you opine that knowledge

will lead me to the right path. (3.2)
Comments: Sri Rayaru in GV makes a reference to verse 2.49 which
spoke about the supremacy of the path of knowledge over the path of
action. However, in other verses such as 2.37, Krishna exhorts Arjuna to
follow the path of action by waging the just war as that was Arjuna’s
prescribed duty. Arjuna is now questioning as to which is the superior path.
He wonders whether he should renounce everything, become an ascetic and
follow the path of knowledge which would lead him to liberation.

The Lord said: O Anagha (Arjuna, the one without sins)! As
explained before, in this world there are two paths towards liberation
depending on one’s innate nature, talent, and situation. Kings such as
Janaka (karma yogi) achieved liberation by sincerely ruling their kingdoms
(path of action), and sages such as Sanaka (jnana yogi) achieved liberation
by learning, teaching, and spreading spiritual knowledge to others (path of
knowledge). (3.3)

Chapter 3

87

Comments: Lord Krishna clarifies that there are two main paths to
liberation, based on one’s innate nature, ability, and eligibility. Arjuna, as a
ruler, belongs to the karma yogi class and hence he should perform his
prescribed duty of waging this war to protect his citizens. This answers
Arjuna’s question in 3.1. It is further clarified in GV that everyone must
follow both the path of knowledge and the path of action. However, in
jnana yogis, knowledge is predominant and hence they should follow the
path of knowledge and in the process also follow necessary activities (path
of action). Likewise, for karma yogis such as Arjuna, the path of action
(war, in this case) is the superior path and traversing that path also requires
a certain amount of knowledge (path of knowledge). As such, karma yoga
and jnana yoga refer to the aspect of action or knowledge that is
predominant in a person’s nature. This also means that everyone of us
should introspect within ourselves as to the proper path for us to follow,
depending on our innate nature, talent, interest, and ability. For one who
sincerely prays to the Lord, the path will become clear.
Action (Karma) is Mandatory for Everyone

One cannot escape bondage from actions just by relinquishing
actions. Also, one cannot directly achieve liberation only by performing
duties without expectations (nishkama karma). (3.4)
Comments: Krishna instructs Arjuna not to avoid performing
prescribed duties. There are three reasons that Arjuna could have for
avoiding duties: (a) Once liberated (in moksha), there are no compulsions
on duties, so in preparation, it may be best to avoid actions (and focus on
knowledge) in this world itself; (b) focus on activities might bind one in
worldly life and lead to expectations; and, (c) some scriptures say that
action comes in the way of attaining moksha, based on the phrase –

88

The Bhagavad Gita

‘karmana badhyate jantuhu’ (one gets bound by activity – in other words,
actions come in the way of liberation).
Lord Krishna responds to the reasoning in ‘a’ by using the word
purusha in this verse which stands for one with a physical body (gross or
subtle). The physical body is designed for performing actions. Hence, the
existence of the body contradicts the reasoning in ‘a’. The use of the word
purusha also implies that one has gone through many births. Just because,
one decides not to perform any actions in this birth, it does not mean that
they did not perform activities in prior births. So, does it mean that one can
never achieve liberation? This argument makes the reasoning in ‘b’
untenable. Actions performed with expectations on outcomes do come in
the way of moksha. This does not apply to all actions, especially actions
performed without expectations. Hence, reasoning in ‘c’ is also invalid.
Even nishkama karma does not, by itself directly lead to moksha. This type
of action leads to purity in mind which allows one to absorb spiritual
studies, eventually paving the way for liberation.
So, the path to liberation is to avoid activities with expectations and
perform prescribed activities -> mental peace -> detachment from worldly
objects -> concentrated listening, reflection, meditation on the Lord
Almighty -> divine knowledge -> liberation. The process involved in these
steps are clarified in the following verses.

One cannot survive for a single second without performing any

Comments: This verse further clarifies the real meaning of the
scriptural phrase ‘karmana badhyate jantuhu’ (one gets bound by activity –
in other words, activity comes in the way of liberation). Some may use this

Chapter 3

89

phrase to avoid doing any activity. The Lord clarifies that it is impossible
for any living being to survive without activity. Even breathing is an
activity. Even realized souls, as long as they are alive, will keep performing
activities as ordained by the independent Lord Almighty, based on
interaction with material nature.

One who controls actions of sense organs in pursuing sense objects,

O Arjuna! The better path for one is to perform prescribed duties
using the sense organs of action (hands etc.), while controlling the sense
organs of perception (eyes, ears etc.) through the mind. (3.7)
Comments: One can understand that one must perform some
activities for the sake of physical well-being, and it is impossible to avoid
all activities. But why not avoid other activities such as performing rituals
etc.? The Lord answers this question by stating that one must perform
prescribed activities such as performing rituals. This is elaborated in later
verses. The point being made is that mere performing of activities will not
bind someone and come in the way of liberation. It is the mental condition
with which one performs action that would bind a person.

Comments: If it is the mind that comes in the way of one’s attaining
liberation, and duty is also mandatory, what type of duty should one
perform? The answer is – one must perform duties prescribed to one’s
profession based on one’s innate nature, talent, and training. After all, one
must perform duties for livelihood in a society.

Comments: This verse provides more clarifications on spiritual texts
that outwardly seem to indicate that activities will bind and come in the
way of liberation. Building on the argument in verse 3.8 that one has to
keep performing some activity or the other at least to sustain life, this verse
states that the spiritual text quoted in the comments section of 3.5 refers
only to those activities that are not performed as an offering to Lord
Almighty. The word yagna used here refers to Lord Vishnu, as the root
word gna means knowledge, and Lord Vishnu is omniscient (all knowing).
Activities that are performed as an offering to the Lord will not bind
anyone and in fact, will lead one to liberation.

addressed the people thus - by performing these sacrifices you will achieve

Comments: In the four verses from 3.10 to 3.13, the Lord describes
the concept of yagna (ritual sacrifice) that came into existence at the time
of creation of humans. Every aspect of this universe including the elements
of nature, the parts of a human body etc., are activated by deities who have
been given that power by the Lord Almighty. One must perform ritual
sacrifices to propitiate the deities, who, when pleased will fulfill the desires
of the citizenry. The concept of arthavada is utilized here to convey the
importance of performing yagna. Arthavada is a logical construct that
simultaneously uses praise (stuti) and admonition (ninda) in conveying a
concept. Those who perform the prescribed rituals earn the grace of the
deities and those who consume riches without sharing them are
admonished.

sacrifices to perform activities as an offering to the Lord Almighty, will not
only please the deities but will also move towards liberation. Excessive,
selfish consumption of riches earned without giving back to society leads to
one’s downfall.

Comments: These 2 verses describe the Cyclic Order of the
Universe to convey the importance of yagna (Vedic sacrifices) that one
needs to perform. This cyclic order ensures orderly functioning of the
universe and if broken, will result in chaos and anarchy due to the
imbalances. Living beings come into physical existence through the food
chain, which is represented by rice. Rain (governed by the deity Parjanya –
Sun) causes rice to grow. Parjanya, when pleased by the yagna performed
by the citizenry causes rain. Human beings invoke the Lord Almighty
through Vedic hymns (as the Lord is known through the Vedas) and the
Lord powers humans to perform their prescribed duties (karma) and
propitiate the deities through yagna. This cycle is represented as follows:
Rice -> Humans -> Vedic Prayers - > Lord’s Grace -> Prescribed duties ->
Ritual sacrifices -> Offering to Deities (Parjanya) -> Rain -> Rice.
Yagna, the concept of offering to deities through ritual sacrifices is
an especially important aspect of Hindu philosophy and its meaning is
described in later verses.

One who does not respect and follow this cycle of life is leading a
wasteful life. Such people are interested only in pursuing sense pleasures,
and they lead a sinful life. (3.16)
Comments: The Lord teaches that everyone must play his role in the
circle of life to ensure proper functioning of the cyclic order of the
universe. This order is an interaction amongst its constituent parts namely,
the individual souls, the inert matter (material nature) and the Lord
Almighty. Even from practical experience, we all know that there is a
specific order in nature that one must follow. We witness every day the
perils of deviating from this order in terms of global warming, excessive
rains, floods, earthquakes, pandemics etc. The Gita teaches that everyone
must understand their role in the universe and not waste their lifetime by

94

The Bhagavad Gita

senselessly pursuing sense pleasures constantly. Some can point out to the
instances where even after performing the stipulated yagna, one does not
see the effects such as rains, sumptuous harvest etc., and question the
validity of these claims. One must note that mechanically performing these
rituals will not yield results and they must be accompanied with sincerity in
purpose and most importantly, as an offering to the Supreme Lord.
At this stage, one may ask a question as to the applicability of these
rituals to the population other than married householders, such as students
(brahmachari), those who have retired from active life (vanprasthi) and
ascetics (sanyasis). After all, not everyone would have access to all
material utilities that would be required to perform these rituals. Sri Rayaru
[GV] clarifies that yagna has different meanings based on ones stage in
life. For example, for brahmcharis, serving their teachers (guru) is the
stipulated yagna. For ascetics who have renounced all material utilities,
yagna refers to mental (manasika) and vocal (vachaka) sacrifices.
Studying, teaching, and lecturing about the scriptures is the stipulated
yagna for ascetics. For vanaprasthis, performing activities without hurting
any living organism constitutes yagna. In other words, yagna is mandatory
for everyone, but the stipulated activity depends on one’s stage in life. Sri
Vidyasagara Madhava Teertha indicated the example of some saints who,
in addition to jnana yagna (sacrifice through knowledge), dhyana yagna
(sacrifice through meditation), etc., practice the yagna of writing poetry on
the greatness of the Lord Almighty. For them, poetry (kavana) and singing
in praise of the Lord is savana (yagna).

Comments: In verses 3.4, 3.10 etc., the requirements for performing
one’s stipulated duties were described. Previously, it was pointed out that
ascetics perform mental and vocal yagna by way of studying, teaching, and
lecturing as everyone must perform their assigned duties. A question that
arises then is about the case of those who while meditating have reached
the state of ultimate consciousness (asamprajnata samadhi). In this state
they would not even be aware of their surroundings, and they would be
fully immersed in the Lord. This verse states that one who is completely
immersed in the Lord and has reached the state of ultimate consciousness
will by God’s grace be fully contented and has no obligations to perform
any activities. Such a person will not have interest in any matter other than
the Lord.

There is nothing to be gained by such a person by performing duties

Comments: Everyone has an obligation to perform prescribed duties
many of which must be performed at specified times. Is it necessary for one
to wake up a person who is in the state of ultimate consciousness to allow
that person to perform prescribed duties at specified times? Sri Rayaru in
GV answers by stating that, as per this verse, such a person has no such
obligations. Further, that person does not have to wake up from the state of
deep meditation and ultimate consciousness even to greet elders, teachers
etc., as no further benefits will be derived. Such a person has already
realized the Lord and hence has no obligation to perform duties.

Wise emperors such as Janaka achieved salvation through their

Comments: Wise emperors such as Janaka have already achieved
divine, spiritual knowledge and are destined to reach the Lord’s abode. If
so, why did they continue to perform duties? This verse answers by stating
that even such people would experience deeper levels of bliss in moksha on
account of additional duties performed. In addition, they performed duties
to set an example to the masses. Likewise, Arjuna needs to focus on duties
as he is considered a role model to his citizens. While, attaining nirvana
requires one to acquire divine, spiritual knowledge, such knowledge
accrues only when someone performs prescribed duties without
expectations. In that sense the relationship between duty and knowledge is
like the one between a yoke and the shoulders of a person using that yoke

Chapter 3

to till the land. The yoke is an implement, but the actual effort is from the
person’s shoulders.

to perform activities to guide the masses. This verse further clarifies that
concept. While societies may have written rules and regulations for their
citizenry, the fine conduct of their leaders provides live examples of action
which the masses can emulate.

98

The Bhagavad Gita

If I ever stop my activities, everyone will lose their way and end up
in misery. The resulting anarchy will lead to the growth of an unholy
society, and I will be held responsible for it. (3.24)
Comments: These verses answer the question that one may have as
to whether the Lord has any obligation to perform any activities. The Lord
states that He has no such obligation as He is the absolute owner of all the
worlds and has no needs. Even then, He performs activities out of
compassion to set an example for everyone. The Lord activates everyone’s
activities, but He is not impacted by activities of others; like a catalytic
agent that causes changes in other objects but itself does not undergo
changes. If the Lord stops performing activities, there is a danger that
everyone in society, devoid of examples, may also stop performing their
prescribed activities, interrupting the cycle of the universe, resulting in
societal dysfunction.

Comments: This verse describes how a wise one should act as a role
model to ignorant ones in performing duties. Many times, mere preaching
about the need for performing prescribed duties without expectations will
not convince ignorant ones who are focused on activities for material gains.
Wise ones instead should demonstrate the proper way of performing
prescribed duties through action as an offering to the Lord and not through
mere words. Through their actions, they should motivate and encourage the
ignorant to perform right deeds.

Ignorant ones, unaware that the Lord Almighty activates everyone’s

nature, wrongly conclude that they perform actions on their own. (3.27)
Comments: This verse provides further explanations on verses 3.25
and 3.26. Sri Rayaru in GV provides an excellent explanation on the inner
meanings of the terms prakriti and guna appearing in this verse which carry
3 sets of meanings. Firstly, prakriti and guna refer to the Lord Almighty
and His 3 attributes, namely, will, knowledge, and attempt. Secondly, the
terms prakriti and guna refer to the three types of individual souls
(superior, ordinary, and inferior) and their 3 attributes of knowledge,
namely, correct knowledge, mixed knowledge, and false knowledge.
Thirdly, the terms prakriti and guna, refer to inert nature and its 3
attributes, namely sat (piety), rajas (passion) and tamas (ignorance). With
these interpretations, this verse can be expanded to mean as follows-Lord
Almighty is independent and is the instrumental cause for activities
performed by everyone based on their innate attributes using inert nature as

100

The Bhagavad Gita

the material cause and their sense organs as the instruments. The attributes
of inert nature impact the actions performed by the sense organs. Ignorant
ones think that they are performing the actions on their own using their
sense organs of action.

O Arjuna, The one with strong arms! Learned ones, aware of the
distinction in the attributes and activities between the Lord and ordinary
souls, know that their sense organs perform their activities as willed by the
Lord. Such people will not get entangled in worldly life. (3.28)
Comments: The previous verse stated that ignorant ones believe that
they act independently, and this verse describes the views of learned ones.
The learned ones are aware that the Lord Almighty is independent and
causes activity in individual souls based on their innate nature. They have a
good understanding of the divisions among attributes (guna) and action
(karma). Attributes here have different meanings depending on the entity.
The attributes of the Lord are will, knowledge, and attempt. For the
individual souls they are the innate nature of being superior, ordinary, and
inferior. The attributes of inert nature are sat(piety), rajas(passion), and
tamas(ignorance). Likewise, the actions of the 3 entities are also different.
The Lord is independent. Individual souls which are dependent on the Lord
act according to their innate nature, and inert nature which is also
dependent on the Lord undergoes transformation based on its 3 attributes of
sat, rajas and tamas. Sri Rayaru in GV provides two equally meaningful
interpretations for the first half of the second line (guna guneshu vartanta).
First interpretation – The Lord’s attributes (guna) initiate actions (guneshu)
in individual souls based on their innate nature. The second interpretation –
Individual soul’s sense organs (guna) act on sense objects (guneshu) based
on the Lord’s will and the individual’s innate nature. In summary, the
learned ones understand that they are not independent and with proper

Chapter 3

101

conviction they avoid getting entangled in worldly activities as they are
focused on the Lord Almighty.

Ignorant ones, unaware of the distinction in attributes and activities
between the Lord and ordinary souls, get entangled in worldly pleasures
and develop addiction. Learned ones who have proper spiritual knowledge
need not waste time teaching them. (3.29)
Comments: Should the learned advise the ignorant ones? This verse
answers by stating that ignorant ones who are in constant pursuit of sense
pleasures would develop an addiction and the learned ones need not waste
their time on teaching them. Souls have innate natures and those who are
naturally inclined to be ignorant can never be transformed. For example,
nature includes cruel animals such as scorpions, snakes, tigers etc. It is in
their nature to be cruel. One cannot transform them. The natural ecology of
the universe requires different species to exist and not all species have the
same attributes. The Lord does not interfere with the innate nature of souls
but allows them to exist and act based on their attributes.

Submit all your activities to Me without ego and without

your fear of losing near and dear ones and fight this just war. (3.30)
Comments: After discussing the ways that learned ones and ignorant
ones perform their duties, and differences in their approaches, the Lord
summarizes this topic by exhorting Arjuna to perform his prescribed duty
of waging the war as an offering to Him. He is to do this without any
expectations and without ego, knowing fully well that it is the Lord who is

102

The Bhagavad Gita

powering him in his efforts. Sri Rayaru in GV explains that the word
adhyatma can be derived in two ways – atmanam adhikrutya sthitam and
adhikam chaasow atma, and both mean Supreme Lord. Also, as per
Brahma Tarka, every activity must be performed as a worship (or an
offering) to the Lord Almighty.
This verse is indicated as the summary of the entire chapter 3 by Sri
Madinur Vishnu Teertha Swamiji [BGS]. Given that the backdrop for the
Gita is Arjuna’s refusal to fight the war, in this verse the Lord conclusively
directs Arjuna to wage the just war as an offering to Him without ego or
any expectations of the outcome (karma yoga). Hence, this verse is aptly a
summary of chapter 3.

Those who always follow My teachings without disdain and perform

Those who treat this teaching with disdain, with hatred towards Me,
and fail to perform their prescribed duties will never gain divine, spiritual
knowledge and will fall into misery. (3.32)
Comments: Learned ones perform their prescribed activities without
ego and expectations on the outcome. What do others gain by following
this? What is the disadvantage for someone who does not follow this?
Verses 3.31 and 3.32 answer these questions. Those who always perform
their prescribed activities without disdain towards the Lord (disdain is
thinking that the Lord is causing them to indulge in difficult activities) will
be rid of bondage and will also attain salvation. Sri Rayaru in GV provides
an interesting explanation for the use of the term api (meaning also), in

Chapter 3

103

verse 3.31. This verse states that anyone who follows the path indicated
will eventually attain salvation. The use of api implies that salvation is
assured for those who have achieved self-realization (aparoksha jnanis).
Verse 3.32 clarifies that those who do not follow this path due to
false knowledge will not only be denied salvation but will be destined to
unending misery.

Comments: If one is denied salvation for not following the path
described previously, why does one not follow this path? This verse
answers by stating that everyone behaves based on their predisposition.
Even learned ones are not immune to the effects of attachment and
aversion. The intrinsic nature of a soul causes one to behave in a particular
manner. Mere controlling of sense organs will not be of much help. Verse
(3.31) also indicates that one cannot transform others’ intrinsic nature.

Comments: In verse 3.30, it was stated that one must perform one’s
prescribed duties as an offering to the Lord and verse 3.31 stated the
advantage of such an action. However, verse 3.33 indicated that one’s
activities are governed by one’s innate nature. If so, how can one then act
as instructed in verse 3.30? This verse answers this question by stating that
one’s activities are modulated by one’s emotions such as attachment and
aversion. Even though it is extremely difficult to control these emotions,
one must make a sincere attempt. The deserving ones will surely succeed.

It is better for one to perform prescribed duties (in accordance with

performing one’s relevant duties as taking up non-relevant duties will only
lead to downfall. (3.35)
Comments: In the beginning of this chapter, in verse 3.1, Arjuna
asks Krishna two questions. (i) If knowledge is superior to action, why
perform any activity at all? (ii) Since actions such as waging a war can
have negative consequences such as killing elders and teachers, why
indulge in such a war? Lord Krishna responded to the first question in verse
3.3 and aspects of the second question in verses 3.30 and 3.34 by stating
that Arjuna should wage the war as an offering to the Lord without getting
influenced by emotions. This verse answers the ‘why’ aspect of the second
question. Everyone is prescribed certain responsibilities in a society based
on their personal situations. Arjuna belonged to the ruling kshatriya class
and had an obligation to protect his citizens. Hence, the best path for him is
to wage this war despite its unpleasant consequences, rather than shirk his
responsibilities and take up some other vocation such as studying, teaching
etc.

Comments: In verse 3.34, the Lord instructs that one should conquer
emotions such as desire and aversion which lead one to downfall. Arjuna
seems to be asking Him which emotion is the strongest and most difficult
to conquer even when one has the right intentions.

The Lord said: Desire and anger push one to commit sinful activities.
These are born out of the natural attribute of passion. One can never satiate
them. They are the greatest enemies of a seeker. Among them, desire is the
stronger enemy as it is the root cause of anger. (3.37)
Comments: In verses 2.62 and 2.63, the relationship and
interconnection between the emotions of desire, anger, miserliness,
obsession, arrogance, and jealousy were discussed. Desire or lust is the root
cause for all these emotions which causes one’s downfall. Anger arises out
of the attribute of passion, but desire is the root cause for anger. The Lord
uses the term mahashana to describe desire, meaning that it can never be
satiated. Everyone knows by experience that cravings of sense organs can

106

The Bhagavad Gita

never be permanently satiated by indulging in them. Even when one
consumes very tasty, sumptuous food and feels contented, that feeling
evaporates by the next day and cravings will resurface. Trying to satiate
desire by indulgence is like trying to douse a fire with ghee. The fire
continues to rage. Desire or lust is the root cause of one’s downfall and
prevents one from achieving liberation. Sri Rayaru in GV explains that the
emotion of desire is influenced by the demon Kalinemi.

Just as smoke hides fire, just as dust covers a mirror and just as a

(3.38)
Comments: While the previous verse 3.37 identified desire or lust as
the root cause of evil, this verse explains the strength of this emotion
through three different examples. Sri Rayaru in GV explains the reason for
using these three different examples. These are related respectively to the
three classes of beings, namely pious, passionate, and ignorant. Pious souls
can also get enveloped by lust just as smoke covers a fire. However, just as
one can see and feel the fire to some extent even when covered by smoke,
pious beings can visualize the Lord even when influenced by desire. So
they have the most to gain by controlling desire. Passionate souls are
covered by desire just as dirt covers a mirror. With some effort, one can
wipe the mirror clean and likewise passionate souls with effort can
overcome the influence of desire. Ignorant souls are under the tight grip of
desire just like a womb covers a fetus strongly. Such souls who are under
the constant influence of lust can never overcome this emotion and fail to
realize the Lord.

Chapter 3

107

Sri Rayaru provides a second explanation for the three analogies.
These analogies are related to the Lord, one’s mind and individual soul,
respectively. The Lord is self-effulgent but when one is covered by desire,
the Lord cannot be seen just as fire cannot be seen when covered by smoke.
When a mirror is covered with dust one cannot see the reflection of the
original object. Similarly, when one’s mind is covered by desire, one
cannot visualize the Lord. Thirdly, when one is in the very tight grip of lust
just as a fetus is covered by a strong womb, one cannot obtain true divine,
spiritual knowledge.

O Son of Kunti! Desire is the greatest enemy of a seeker. It can never
be satiated, and it is never satisfied. It can shroud the intellect of even
learned ones. (3.39)
Comments: The Lord continues to answer Arjuna’s question from
verse 3.36. Does desire or lust impact even those who have acquired
spiritual knowledge? This verse answers by stating that even learned ones
are impacted by the force of lust. Previously it was stated that desire
shrouds the three entities – knowledge about the Lord, knowledge about the
individual and knowledge about the individual’s mind. Even spiritual
knowledge learnt through a teacher can get shrouded by lust and prevent a
seeker from acquiring divine knowledge. Lust is never satiated. It is even
stronger than fire. After all a fire gets extinguished once it consumes
flammable material in its way. But lust remains unsatiated even after one
indulges in it.

Desire finds a home in one’s sense organs, mind, and intellect. It is
through these elements that desire clouds ones judgement and leads one
astray. (3.40)
Comments: Where does the quality of desire/lust reside in an
individual? Lord Krishna previously stated that desire is the strongest
enemy that comes in the way of one’s spiritual journey. So, it is natural for
one to look for the source of desire. After all, if one wants to conquer an
enemy, one needs to know the location of the enemy. This verse answers
by stating that lust finds home in one’s sense organs, mind, and intellect.
Control Sense Organs to Overcome Desire

O Arjuna (Superior among the Bharatas)! Therefore, you should first
control sense organs and destroy desire which can shroud both ordinary and
special spiritual knowledge. (3.41)
Comments: The Lord continues to provide answers to Arjuna’s
question in a logical manner. If desire has its home in one’s sense organs
(including mind) and intellect, how does one control desire? The Lord
answers by stating that one needs to control the sense organs to be able to
control desire. Desire is a strong force that can shroud both ordinary and
special knowledge (jnana and vijnana). Ordinary knowledge refers to
knowledge that one acquires through study and through teachers. Special
knowledge refers to the deep knowledge that one acquires by study,
meditation, and contemplation of scriptural texts such as the Vedas,
Puranas etc.
In the current context, Arjuna’s knowledge is shrouded by his mental
weakness due to the fear of losing his near and dear ones in the war. The

Chapter 3

109

Lord exhorts him to conquer his mind and focus on performing his
prescribed duty.
At this stage, it is useful to understand the concept of desire.
Scriptures state that there are four aspects to one’s activities – dharma
(right conduct), artha (material riches), kama (desire) and moksha
(liberation). There is a discussion in the Mahabharata regarding the
relative importance of these four aspects. Vidura states that moksha is the
most important one as that is everyone’s goal. Bheema states that kama is
the most important. Naturally, everyone is curious to find out more.
Bheema states that desire can be either lofty (positive) or primal (negative).
After all, one would work towards moksha only when one has the desire
(kama) to achieve moksha. So, lofty desires are not prohibited. It is primal
desire or lust that entangles living beings.

It is said that the sense organs are superior, and the mind is more
superior to them. Intellect is superior to the mind and the ultimate
consciousness (the Supreme Lord) is even more superior to the intellect.
(3.42)
Comments: After describing the impact that desire/lust has on a
seeker’s spiritual journey and stating that desire is rooted in the sense
organs, it was concluded that one must exert control over the sense organs
in order to conquer desire. It was also indicated that desire is an immensely
powerful emotion and even learned ones fall prey to it. A natural question
that one would have at this stage is as follows – how can one control the
sense organs (including the mind)? This verse answers by indicating that
the weapon to conquer desire is knowledge. As the enemy resides in an
individual’s faculties, one must understand the relative importance of

110

The Bhagavad Gita

various faculties. Only then can one conquer desire. To control desire, one
must control one’s sense organs. To control the sense organs, one must
conquer obsession with objects of sensory perception and to do this one
must control the mind. To control the mind, one must be able to control the
intellect. But these are all inert entities. How can they help one control
desire? Sri Rayaru [GV] explains the inner meaning of this verse by
explaining that the faculties indicated here imply the respective controlling
deities who activate the faculties. The relative gradation among the
faculties and their controlling deities implied in this verse is as follows.
Sense organs (and their controlling deities such as Indra) are superior to
other organs in the body (and their controlling deities such as Prithvi).
Objects of sensory perception (and their controlling deities such as Parvati)
are superior to the sense organs (and their controlling deities). The Mind
(and its controlling deity such as Rudra) is superior to objects of sensory
perception (and their controlling deities). The Intellect (and controlling
deity such as Saraswati) is superior to the mind (and its controlling deities).
The principle of consciousness (and its controlling deities such as Brahma)
is superior to intellect (and its controlling deities). The unmanifest principle
(the inert nature and its controlling deity Mahalakshmi) is superior to the
principle of consciousness. The supreme Lord Almighty is superior to the
unmanifest principle (and to all controlling deities). The Lord has indicated
many times that one must perform one’s prescribed duties without
expectations, as an offering to Him. This verse gives everyone an assurance
that we are not alone in this universe and the various angelic forces that
control all activities in this universe, and indeed in our bodies can help us
in conquering desire if we approach our prescribed duties with sincerity
and as an offering to the Lord.

Comments: The Lord concludes His teaching in this chapter by
exhorting Arjuna to control his emotions and focus on performing his
prescribed duty of fighting the just war by submitting to His will.
Summary of Chapter 3
This chapter is a continuation of chapter 2, where the Lord provides
more details on the concept of duties without expectations. In the first 2
verses, Arjuna expresses confusion about the superiority between the paths
of knowledge and action. In verses 3.3-3.9, the Lord teaches that both these
paths lead to liberation and the choice of path depends on one’s innate
nature, talent, and background. The Lord also cautions Arjuna against
avoiding all actions as no one can survive without performing some action.
The Lord also provides clarification on the nature of duties that are
prescribed to living beings. In verses 3.10-3.13, the Lord introduces the
concept of yagna (ritual sacrifice) and the need for one to perform them to
propitiate the deities who govern the various entities essential for the
functioning of this universe. The Lord explains the Cyclic Order of the
Universe in verses 3.14-3.16 where the interrelationships among the
various constituents of the universe, namely – the individual souls, the
deities, inert nature, and the supreme Lord are briefly presented. For the
universe to function, everyone must play their designated role in the circle
of life. In verses 3.17-3.21, the Lord teaches that those who have achieved
the state of ultimate consciousness and have realized the Lord have no
obligation to perform duties. Likewise, souls that are liberated have no
obligation to perform any activities. However, they continue to perform
activities to set an example to the masses. Such souls do enjoy deeper
levels of bliss in moksha. In verses 3.22-3.24, the Lord clarifies that He has
no obligation to perform any activity but does so out of pure compassion to
set an example to others and to ensure order in society. Verses 3.25-3.29
describe the manner of activities performed by the ignorant ones and the
learned ones. It also briefly describes the divisions and distinctions among
the three constituents of the universe (the Lord Almighty, individual souls,

112

The Bhagavad Gita

and inert nature) in terms of their attributes and actions. Learned ones
understand these divisions and are aware that they do not act
independently. In verse 3.30, the Lord summarizes the previous verses and
instructs Arjuna to overcome ego and attachment and wage the war as an
offering to Him. In verses 3.33 to 3.35, the Lord speaks about the strong
influence of one’s innate nature on one’s activities. In verse 3.36, Arjuna
asks Krishna why one indulges in sinful activities even when one is not
inclined to do so. The Lord provides a detailed response to Arjuna in a
logical, sequential manner in verses 3.37 to 3.43. To conquer desire, one
must control one’s sense organs, mind, and intellect. These are controlled
by angelic forces with relative gradation which are working under the
control of the supreme Lord. One must focus on performing one’s
prescribed duties as an offering to the Lord and, by His grace, conquer
desire.

Chapter 4 - Wisdom in Action
Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 42 verses is known as Jnana
Yoga (The Path of Knowledge). It is predominantly about the spiritual
knowledge that a seeker needs to perform prescribed action (karma).
Knowledge regarding the individual souls, various deities and the attributes
of the Lord Almighty are explained to instill devotion in a seeker. The Lord
explains that He incarnates in this world from time to time to establish
virtue and to vanquish immorality. Knowledge about the various types of
actions – right action, wrong action and inaction are also covered here. In
the previous chapter, in verse 3.8, the Lord taught that one must perform
one’s prescribed duties without expectations (nishkama karma). In this
chapter, till verse 4.15, some important attributes of the Lord Almighty are
described. Verses 4.16 to 4.23 provide a comparison of nishkama karma to
other types of activities with details of the types of nishkama karma such as
worship and sacrifice. A central feature of this chapter is the classification
and description of the different types of sacrifices (yagna) or austerities that
yogis perform. These are described in verses 4.25 to 4.30.

Comments: In verse 3.30, the Lord taught that one should perform
one’s prescribed duties without expectations as an offering to Him. In
verses 3.31, 3.32 and others the Lord indicated the advantages and
disadvantages of performing or not performing the duties as stated. The
Lord backs up these arguments by providing examples of seekers in the
past who have followed the path shown by the Lord and have achieved
greatness. The Lord uses the term avyaya (imperishable) to indicate the
permanent nature of such divine, spiritual knowledge. So, the reference to
deities who over time had acted as advised previously is very pertinent.

Emperors and rishis (sages) learnt and taught this knowledge
successively from one generation to the next. O Parantapa (Arjuna, The
tormentor of enemies)! Due to the passage of time this knowledge has
disappeared. (4.2)
Comments: Sri Rayaru ascribes in GV 2 meanings to the word
‘rajarshi’. One meaning raja + rishi = emperors + sages. Second one
meaning rajasu rushayaha = superior among emperors. This is important
because Arjuna is also a king, and many emperors, sages, and superior
emperors had followed the path taught by Krishna, implying that Arjuna
should take note of these examples. While that knowledge had passed on
from one generation to the next, it had faded due to the passage of time.
Hence the need for Lord Krishna to reiterate them here.

The same ancient supreme and secretive knowledge has been

115

Comments: The Lord states that Arjuna is receiving this precious and
confidential teaching as Arjuna is His devotee and friend (Verse (2.7)). Sri
Rayaru explains in GV that the use of the term hi implies two reasons for
the Lord doing so I am teaching this to you as you are my devotee and friend.
 This ancient knowledge is supreme and secretive.
The spiritual knowledge taught in the Gita is a summary of the
scriptures such as Pancha Ratra that was taught by Lord Vishnu to deities
such as Brahma, Vayu, Rudra, Indra, Surya, Yama, the Ashwini twins etc.
In verse 3.20, the example of king Janaka was quoted to demonstrate the
practice of nishkama karma among householders (who have family and
societal responsibilities). The three verses 4.1 to 4.3 give examples of other
great souls who have benefitted from this knowledge.

Arjuna said: Krishna! Your birth is in recent times. Surya (the Sun

Comments: In verse 3.30, the Lord stated that to achieve liberation
one must perform one’s prescribed duties without expectation, as an
offering to Him. This implies that the Lord is supreme and worthy of
worship. In other verses such as 2.12, the Lord clarified that He does not
experience births and deaths like individual souls. Sri Rayaru in GV
explains that Arjuna (a jnani himself who had already listened to Krishna’s
teachings in Chapter 2 and 3) was not asking about the Lord’s birth (or
manifestations), but about the evidence to prove the difference between the
Lord Almighty and individual souls.

The Lord said: O Arjuna! Many manifestations of Mine and many
births of yours have come and gone. O! Parantapa! I know them all clearly,

Comments: By stating that He always has many manifestations, the
Lord answers Arjuna’s question in 4.4 as to how He taught the knowledge
to Surya who has been in existence for a long time. The Lord manifests
(appears) at different times which are loosely termed as the Lord’s births.
This is quite different from individual souls such as Arjuna who experience
many births and deaths. Further, the Lord clarifies that He is aware of all
His incarnations and all births of others, but the individual souls are not
aware of their many births. Hence this verse draws out the superiority and
omniscient nature of the Lord as distinct from individual souls.

I am not born like everyone; My body does not perish, and I am the

Me, I manifest Myself in My transcendental form based on My own free
will. (4.6)
Comments: The Lord seemed to indicate in verse 4.5 that He appears
and disappears many times. But in verse 2.17, the Lord stated that He does
not cease to exist. How can thus be reconciled? The next few verses detail
the concept of manifestation as it relates to the Lord. The Lord does not
experience physical births as experienced by individual souls. The term

Chapter 4

117

birth (janma) when used in the context of Lord, relates to His manifestation
which He does at His own free will using the entities of material nature that
He Himself created. This is explained in the phrase prakritim swam
adhishtaya. Sri Rayaru in GV interprets this phrase in three different ways:
 The Lord, in an incarnation such as Krishna manifests Himself
through the bodies of Vasudeva and Devaki which He Himself had
created.
 The Lord utilizes Goddess Durga (governor of tamasic nature) who
is under His control, to cause ignorant souls to consider His
manifestation as an ordinary birth.
 The Lord performs the above two actions of His own free will.
These 3 interpretations provide answers to the three questions that arise
here.
Question 1: What does the statement that the Lord takes birth at a
specific time and place when His body and soul are eternal mean? For
example, the birth of Krishna to Vasudeva and Devaki.
Answer 1: Inert nature is under the control of the Lord Almighty. The
Lord gives physical bodies comprised of material nature to Vasudeva and
Devaki and enters their bodies in His transcendental form and manifests
Himself.
Question 2: What makes some think of the Lord as having a birth like
everyone else?
Answer 2: The Lord causes ignorance in some through Goddess Durga
who acts under His control.
Question 3: What benefit does the Lord get by manifesting Himself
through Vasudeva and Devaki (and indeed other manifestations)?
Answer 3: The Lord’s actions are due to His free will which is His
innate nature and not for any benefit.

Comments: If the Lord has nothing to gain by incarnating, what is
the purpose of His incarnations? These two verses answer by stating that
the Lord incarnates purely out of His free will and out of pure compassion
towards living beings. While the Lord has no obligation to incarnate at any
specific time or place, generally He incarnates from time to time, to protect
the virtuous whenever virtue in the society is obscured, and to destroy the
evil whenever there is an ascension in immorality.

O Arjuna! One who realizes properly that My amazing
manifestations and activities are divine, will not be reborn after leaving
ones body and will reach My abode. (4.9)
Comments: In every manifestation of the Lord such as Lord
Narasimha, Lord Rama, Lord Krishna etc., the Lord has demonstrated
extraordinary powers and activities to advance the cause of righteousness
and to punish the evil. Many times, His actions are meant to set an example
for ideal living as in the case of Lord Rama. These incarnations are detailed

Chapter 4

119

in epics such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata etc. It
must be noted that a seeker needs to have proper understanding of the
Lord’s activities. This is implied in using the term tatvata. It is quite easy to
misunderstand some of the Lord’s activities by looking at them
peripherally. One must understand the real intent of His actions. Only then
can one hope to achieve liberation. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that proper
knowledge of the Lord’s incarnations and activities is necessary for a
seeker to achieve liberation but that is not sufficient. The seeker also needs
to learn about Lord’s other attributes such as omnipresence, omniscience
etc.

Those who have conquered desire, fear, anger and have surrendered

Comments: The previous verse stated that a seeker needs to have
proper knowledge about the Lord’s incarnations and actions. This verse
describes such a seeker as one who has conquered emotions such as desire
(in material objects), fear, and anger. Sri Rayaru [GV] provides an
excellent explanation of this verse as having answered two important
questions:
 Are there seekers who have achieved liberation by properly
understanding the Lord’s incarnations and activities? This verse
describes the attributes of those seekers.
 How does the knowledge about the Lord’s incarnations and activities
lead one to liberation? This verse answers this question by stating
that it is through surrender and devotion to the Lord, one can attain
liberation.

120

The Bhagavad Gita

Arjuna had expressed his surrender to the Lord (2.7) and hence he is a
very eligible seeker.

O Partha! Whoever worships Me with devotion, in whatever way, I
reward them accordingly. Everyone follows the example that I set. (4.11)
Comments: In the previous verses it was stated that one who
worships the Lord will achieve liberation. Will all who worship the Lord
achieve liberation equally? If yes, how can one account for the difference
in efforts and approach? If no, isn’t there partiality in result? This verse
answers these questions stating that among those who worship the Lord,
there are broadly two categories. The first one includes learned ones who
perform activities without expectations and surrender completely to the
Lord. These seekers are destined for liberation. The second category
includes those who, while aware of the supremacy of the Lord, perform
rituals worshipping other deities such as Brahma, Rudra, Indra etc., seeking
temporary fruits such as progeny, wealth etc. Even though this category of
people performs rituals to propitiate other deities, the fact that the Lord is
the ultimate destination for their efforts results in them receiving temporary
rewards.
In the second half of this verse, the Lord clarifies that even offerings
made by the second category of people will eventually reach Him, but they
will not be aware of this fact. The learned ones who act without any
expectation are fully aware of this. Thus, the Lord rewards seekers based
on their effort, conviction, and attitude, purely based on merit. So, there is
no question of partiality.

In this world, people worship and perform sacrifices to propitiate

temporary) will fructify quickly. (4.12)
Comments: This verse provides the reasoning behind the
explanation in the previous verse that all fruits are ultimately obtained from
the Lord, regardless of the deities who are worshipped. It is seen in this
world that one who propitiates other deities do receive fruits from one’s
efforts, but it is the Lord Almighty who ultimately grants wishes based on
one’s efforts and conviction.

I created the four categories (varnas) of beings based on their nature
and activities. Though I created them, I do not have a creator. I also do not
have any obligation to act, and I am eternal. (4.13)
Comments: It was stated previously that it is essential for one to
surrender to the Lord to achieve divine, spiritual knowledge and attain
liberation. This verse explains the reason why one should surrender to
Lord. The Lord is like a father, and children are expected to worship their
father. The Lord, who gave physical bodies to individual entities, provides
details of the categories of people He creates.
This is probably the most controversial and least understood verse in
the Gita as many people associate this verse with the caste system in
society. The four categories here are based on the proportion of the three
innate attributes (sattv, rajas and tamas) of beings. How can there be four

122

The Bhagavad Gita

categories if there are three innate attributes? The four categories are based
on the varying proportions of these three innate attributes. Sri
Madhwacharya provides detailed explanations of the categories (varnas)
and attributes (gunas) in GB and GTN. Individual souls are basically of
three types – angels (deities), humans, and demons. Angels have the quality
of pure sattv and are destined for liberation. Demons have pure tamas and
are destined for hell. Humans have rajas mixed with varying proportions of
sattv, rajas and tamas resulting in satvika rajasas, rajasa rajasas and
rajasa tamasas. Those with a satvik rajasa quality are destined for
liberation and among them are these four categories. As explained by Sri
Jaya Teertha [ND] – these categories are characterized by the following (i) sattv is much greater than rajas (sattv >> rajas), (ii) sattv is somewhat
greater than rajas (sattv > rajas), (iii) sattv and rajas are in equal
proportion but greater than tamas (rajas = sattv > tamas) and, (iv) sattv is
greater than tamas which is greater than rajas (sattv > tamas > rajas). As
stated by Sri Madhwacharya in GB, the qualities of sattv, rajas and tamas
are based on the level of one’s devotion to Lord Almighty Vishnu. One
cannot conclude one’s innate nature just by one’s family of birth. The
categorization of beings based on one’s profession or vocation (karma) is
covered in detail in Chapter 18.
The four categories of people indicated here are generally known as
brahmanas, kshatriyas, vaishyas, and shudras, which also nominally
indicates the profession that they undertake, namely, scholastic pursuits,
administration, commerce, and service industry. All of them are eligible for
liberation. Sri Jaya Teertha in his ND clarifies this concept by stating that
Lord Vishnu’s devotees (vaishnavas) are considered pious because of their
higher levels of sattvic attributes, and not due to their brahminical
profession. Sri Madhwacharya in GTN clarifies that the categorization
based on one’s innate nature (swabhava) manifests in one’s natural
aptitudes such as steadfast devotion to the Lord, self-control, valor,
bravery, farming, commerce, service mindedness etc. This categorization
should not be equated to the societal classification based on one’s family of
birth (oupadika).

Chapter 4

123

While the deities have predominant sattv qualities, Sri Rayaru in his
Prameya Sangraha [PS] provides more details on the categorization of
deities. During the process of subtle creation, all individual souls obtain a
subtle body called Aniruddha deha. During this time, the various deities get
categorized - the four faced deity Brahma as brahmin, deities Vayudeva,
Sesha, Garuda, rudra etc., as kshatriyas, many Suryas, some children of
Aditi, many Maruts, Vasus etc., as vyshyas, and Ashwini twins, Prithvi,
Kala, Mrutyu etc., as shudras. This clearly proves that there is nothing
intrinsically superior or inferior about the categories. They are simply
different from each other.
In the second half of this verse, the Lord clarifies that while He is the
creator of these categories, He is not created by anyone. He also has no
obligation to act.
Notes: Material nature comprises of three qualities, and these are
present in all living beings in varying degrees. The three qualities are sattv,
rajas and tamas. Sattv is generally translated as pure, virtuous, pious etc.,
rajas as passion and tamas as ignorance. Those identified with the quality
of sattv are generally known to have purity in thought, words, and actions.
Sri Madhwacharya identifies an additional attribute as part of sattv. This
attribute is devotion to the Lord as stated by Sri Madhwacharya in his GTN
based on Naradeeya Purana. Hence the translation of sattv as pious is
more appropriate as piety also implies devotion. The quality of rajas leads
one to be passionate about material possessions and sense pleasures. For
brevity, from now on rajas will be translated as passion. The quality of
tamas results in ignorance and delusion and is characterized by excessive
lethargy, sleepiness, and indulgence in sense pleasures. Again, for brevity
tamas will be translated as ignorance.

Actions do not bind Me. I have no interest in any fruits from My
actions. One who truly knows Me thus will not get entangled by actions.
(4.14)
Comments: In the previous verse the Lord stated that He has no
obligation to perform any activities. In the next few verses, He provides the
nature of His activities and contrasts them with those of individual souls.
Actions do not bind the Lord. The Lord has no interest in any outcome of
His actions and acts on His own free will. The reason for individual souls
getting entangled in actions is their expectations. The one who understands
the nature of the Lord’s actions will not be bound by actions. Sri Rayaru in
GV provides a convincing explanation for the inherent difference between
the Supreme Soul and the individual soul based on the choice of words in
this verse. The Lord says ‘yo maam iti abhijanati’, meaning the ones who
know Me (maam, meaning Krishna) thus will not get entangled by actions.
Here, the Lord’s attributes are the subject matter which must be properly
understood by others (yo = individual souls) to get released from bondage.

Learned ones, desirous of salvation, were aware of this truth and

Comments: Why do learned ones who are aware of the Lord’s
attributes about activities act at all? This verse answers by giving the
examples set by earlier generations. In verse 3.30, the Lord had indicated
that emperors such as Janaka achieved liberation by performing their
prescribed duties without expectations. Such superior souls perform
activities out of two reasons. One, to set an example for others in society
and second, to experience exuberance in bliss (in moksha).

Comments: The previous verse taught that a seeker should perform
prescribed duties. This verse provides details on the types of actions – right
actions and inaction. Sri Rayaru in GV provides an interesting explanation
for the use of the Sanskrit word ‘tat’ in this verse. tat is an interesting word
in Sanskrit and its meaning depends on the context. At least 3 meanings of
tat are – therefore, that, and from. The interpretations are –
 Even learned ones get confused about the concept of karma.
Therefore, you must understand it properly
 In the previous verse 4.15, it was indicated that one must perform
prescribed duties (karma). It is that karma which is discussed in this
verse
 One will be rid of bondage by acquiring this knowledge

One should learn what constitutes right action, prohibited action and
inaction, and learn about the distinction between them. All these actions are
under My control. The subject of action (karma) is extremely complex by
nature. (4.17)
Comments: In the previous verse, the words karma (action) and
akarma (inaction) were used where akarma was also interpreted to include
vikarma (prohibited action). In this verse, all three types of actions are

126

The Bhagavad Gita

explicitly stated. Sri Rayaru in GV stresses that one must strive hard to
understand the nature of action, especially since it is an extremely complex
topic.
Sri Rayaru also provides an interesting, second interpretation of this
verse following Sri Madhwacharya’s GTN. The words karmanaha,
vikarmanaha, and akarmanaha can be derived as – karma + naha,
vikarma + naha, and akarma + naha. The word naha means ‘from the
Lord’ (plural). With this derivation, this verse can also be interpreted as
follows – all the three types of action (right action, prohibited action, and
inaction) are implemented by the different forms of the Lord under His
control. ‘Different Forms’ is implied by the plural (naha) indicated above.

The wise realize that they do not perform activities independently
and even when they are not active (during sleeping, dreaming), there is
activity being performed (such as breathing) by the Lord Almighty. Such a
person is performing duties fully and will derive full benefits thereon.
(4.18)
Comments: Having introduced the types of action in previous
verses, the Lord now describes these actions in the next few verses.
Prescribed duties performed by one with the knowledge that the actual
work is enabled by the Lord is doing the right action (karma). The one who
performs duties without knowing that the Lord is enabling one to work
engages in incorrect/futile action (akarma). Actions not approved by the
scriptures constitute prohibited action (vikarma).
Sri Rayaru in GV provides another interesting, second interpretation
of this verse based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GTN. The word karma can also
mean the individual soul based on the obligation to perform duties. The
Lord is also termed akarma as He has no obligation to perform anything.

Chapter 4

127

With this, the verse can be interpreted to mean as follows – the one who
knows that the dependent individual soul has obligation to perform duties,
and that the independent Lord Almighty has no obligation for duties, is
indeed knowledgeable. Such a person is performing right actions fully.
This verse is identified by Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in BGS as
being the summary of this chapter. As this chapter is predominantly about
the concept of action (karma yoga), this verse provides a succinct summary
of the concepts presented.

One who performs prescribed duties and sacrifices without expecting

(4.19)

128

The Bhagavad Gita

One with spiritual knowledge, who is detached from the outcomes of
activities, who is ever contented, and who is focused on the Lord, even
when involved in normal activities will be considered as not performing
any activities. (4.20)
One who performs duties without any expectations, who has control
over mind and intellect, and who has no attachment to the physical body
will not be tainted by sin for actions performed solely for physical
sustenance. (4.21)
One who is content with whatever is given by the Lord, who is
beyond dualities (such as pain or pleasure), who harbors no jealousy and
who treats success or failure with equanimity will not be entangled by
actions. (4.22)
Actions will not taint one who acts without expectations, who is
unattached to the physical body, who has the mind focused on the Lord and
who performs duties as an offering (yagna) to the Lord. (4.23)
Comments: Verse 4.18 identified a wise person as one who performs
prescribed duties fully and perfectly. These five verses describe the major
characteristics of such a person.
1. Pandita: Verse 4.19 describes one who has conclusive knowledge as
Pandita, as recognized by learned ones. Such a person would have
incinerated all activities in the fire of spiritual knowledge.
2. Ever Contented: Verse 4.20 describes a wise person as being ever
contented and not having any needs. Such a person has no
attachment to either activities or any outcomes from activities and
considers the self as a reflection of the independent Lord. Even when
performing actions, such a person is considered as not performing
any action at all, meaning such actions will not be binding.

Chapter 4

129

3. Detached: Verse 4.21 describes a wise person as one who performs
prescribed duties with no bodily attachments. Such a person when
performing day to day activities for physical sustenance will not be
tainted by any sins arising from such actions.
4. Equanimous: Verse 4.22 describes a wise person as one who is not
perturbed by happiness or sadness, gain, or loss etc. Such a person
will not harbor jealousy over someone’s success and will be content
with whatever is granted by the Lord.
5. Conviction in Divine Knowledge: Verse 4.23 summarizes the
characteristics of the wise person described in the previous 4 verses
and states that such a person is able to achieve these characteristics
due to single minded focus on the Lord. Such a person will indeed
perform all prescribed activities without expectations, without bodily
attachment, with knowledge about the independent Lord, and as an
offering (yagna) to please the Lord. Such activities will not entangle
a wise person and will pave the way for liberation by the grace of the
Lord.
Verse 4.22 seems to identify two characteristics of a wise person – one
who is beyond dualities and one who is equipoised in success or failure. Do
these both mean the same and hence there is a repetition here? No. Sri Jaya
Teertha in [PD] clarifies that these two characteristics have a causal
relationship. One who is tolerant of dualities is equipoised in success or
failure.

All articles and substances used in performing Vedic rituals (yagna)
belong to the Lord. Various sacrifices, ghee and indeed fire itself and the

130

The Bhagavad Gita

ritual activities are all under the control of the Lord as He pervades and
owns everything. One who understands this truth will indeed reach the
Lord’s abode. (4.24)
Comments: In the previous verse, a wise person is described as
someone who has conviction in divine knowledge. This verse explains and
describes such conviction. All aspects involved in the performance of
yagna (sacrifice) are under the control of the Lord. This is also consistent
with verse 4.21, where a wise person was described as one who is detached.
Sri Rayaru in GV explains the proper way of interpreting compound words
such as brahma havi following the interpretation in Sri Madhwacharya’s
GTN. There are multiple ways of deriving such compound words in
Sanskrit. There is a danger that one can interpret brahma havi to mean that
the sacrifices offered in a sacrifice is identical with the Lord. Sri
Madhwacharya [GTN] interprets brahma havi as brahmani + havi,
meaning the sacrifices offered in a sacrifice belongs to the Lord. This
applies to other aspects appearing in this verse. This interpretation is also
consistent with the characteristics of a wise person described in verses
4.19 – 4.23.
Notes: The Sanskrit word yagna does not have a direct equivalent in
English. In general, yagna means an intense act or endeavor that is
performed for a specific purpose such as propitiating the Lord Almighty or
some other deities. Many scholars loosely translate yagna as sacrifice,
perhaps referring to offerings that are sacrificed during fire rituals. In
keeping with the traditional translation, yagna will be translated as sacrifice
in this book with the knowledge that yagna actually stands for an intense
endeavor performed for a specific purpose.

Some seekers (especially ascetics) consider worshipping the Lord as
itself equivalent to performing a Vedic ritual (hence the Lord also goes by

the name of yagna). Others (especially householders) visualize the Lord in
the sacrificial fire and perform the rituals. (4.25)
Comments: The next six verses 4-25 to 4-30 describe the different
types of yagna (sacrifice) performed by different seekers to stress the point
that yagna does not mean only performing ritual sacrifices with fire but it
also has a metaphorical meaning.
In a later verse, (4.31) it is indicated that one who does not perform
sacrificial rituals will not achieve anything of value either in this world or
in other worlds. This verse clarifies that for some seekers such as ascetics,
worshipping the Lord is itself a Vedic sacrificial ritual. In verse 4.23, it was
indicated that wise people perform activities for the sake of yagna
(yagnaya acharate). This verse, by specifically stating that ascetics worship
yagna (the Lord), confirms that the word yagna also refers to the Lord
Almighty.

Some offer activities of sense organs of action (hands, legs etc.), and
five types of life breath, in the sacrificial fire of self-control which glows
with spiritual knowledge. (4.27)
Comments: yagna is a generic word that many associate with the
physical act of performing Vedic rituals with fire etc. These verses describe

132

The Bhagavad Gita

yagna metaphorically as defining different types of sacrifices performed by
seekers.
Some seekers exercise control of sense organs of perception - eyes,
ears, tongue, nose, and skin, by restraining excessive indulgence in sense
objects and divert these sense organs towards the Lord. For example,
restraining ears from listening to meaningless worldly stories and focusing
them on the stories of the Lord Almighty. Even when consuming objects of
senses such as food, seekers partake in them with the knowledge that they
are offered to the in-dwelling Lord.

teaching spiritual texts to others. All of them make great attempts to
propitiate the Lord through their sacrifices. (4.28)
Comments: This verse clarifies that sacrifices are performed
physically, vocally, and mentally with examples. Some physically donate
part of their wealth generously to the deserving. Some undertake strict
austerity such as maintaining silence for an extended period of time. This
requires great mental concentration. Some undertake extensive studies and
analysis of concepts in spiritual texts such as the Vedas. Some distribute
their knowledge vocally through teaching and lectures. All these seekers
utilize the tools and talent that the Lord gave them as a selfless sacrifice
and submit them to the Lord Almighty.

Some perform sacrifices through breathing and breath control. They
offer the exhaling breath to the inhaling breath and the inhaling breath to

Comments: Some seekers take the path of pranayama or
management of life breath to achieve self-discipline. These seekers offer
the act of breath retention (kumbhaka) as a sacrifice to the Lord.

Some limit the amount of food they consume and control the ability
of sense organs to indulge in consumption of sense objects. All of them
understand the meaning of sacrifice and get rid of sins through their chosen
method of sacrifice. (4.30)
Comments: In verses 4.26 and 4.27, it was stated that some seekers
perform the sacrifice of controlling their sense organs. In this verse, there is
a specific example of seekers controlling the consumption of food to drive
home the fact that of all indulgences, food is the most difficult to control.
As was indicated in verse 2.59, when one practices fasting, the sense
organs get weakened, but the craving for tasty food does not go away.
When one ages, the sense organs start losing their effectiveness one by one,
but the tongue and its craving for food never goes away. Some seekers
perform the difficult task of controlling their food intake (just enough for
physical existence) by will power and offer this sacrifice to the Lord.
Sri Rayaru in GV gives an additional interpretation for this verse.
Sense organs are controlled by deities such as Indra, Surya etc. Deities such
as Garuda, Rudra, and Sesha who control the functioning of the mind are
superior to the deities controlling the sense organs. Some seekers
understand this hierarchy, control their indulgence in food through will
power and offer that as a sacrifice to the Lord.

in the heavenly worlds. (4.31)
Comments: After describing the types of sacrifices performed by
seekers in verses 4-25 to 4-30, this verse describes the difference in
rewards attained by those who perform these types of sacrifices and those
who do not. One who performs such selfless sacrifices will indeed reach
the Lord and others who do not perform these would have wasted their
lives. It is interesting to note that this verse specifically states that those
who do not perform such sacrifices will not receive any rewards in this
world. How can one prove that? One of the sacrifices identified was control
of food consumption. It is seen by experience that those who indulge in
excessive food consumption on a continuous basis end up with lifestyle
diseases such as obesity, blood pressure etc. Hence, these austerities are
also required to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

directed towards the Lord. This point is expanded later in verse 9.24, where
the Lord declares that He is the owner and indeed the destination for all

Chapter 4

sacrifices. After describing the various types of sacrifices performed by
seekers, the Lord asks Arjuna to understand that these sacrifices are to be
performed mentally, vocally, and physically, and that he should engage in
his prescribed duty of participating in the war to protect his citizens. This
advice is especially important as one can question the need to indulge in a
destructive war when one can achieve liberation by following other
sacrifices such as the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge. This
verse clarifies that one must perform one’s prescribed duty as a worship to
the Lord, which is also a form of sacrifice.

Partha! Even performing prescribed activities requires proper knowledge
for fruitful completion. (4.33)
Comments: Verses 4.25 to 4.30 described different types of
sacrifices performed by seekers in their quest for self-realization and
liberation. Among the different types of sacrifices described, which is
superior? This verse answers by stating that sacrifice in the form of
acquisition and dissemination of divine, spiritual knowledge is most
superior. The reason for its supremacy is its ability to bring to fruition the
prescribed duties performed by a seeker. After all, one cannot perform any
activity, if one does not have the knowledge of the need for such an action,
or the method of performance of such action etc. One cannot conclude that
only acquiring such knowledge is good enough. Such knowledge must be
accompanied by proper performance of prescribed duties for one to succeed
in one’s spiritual journey.

superior, how does one obtain such knowledge? This verse answers by
stating that one must first find a teacher who has truly realized divine,
spiritual knowledge and approach that teacher with respect, humility, and
an inquisitive mind to learn. In verse 2.7, Arjuna had surrendered to Lord
Krishna as his teacher to help clear his doubts. One must follow this
example to acquire true knowledge.

O Pandava! You will be rid of ignorance once you understand My

Comments: Arjuna was stricken with grief at the thought of losing
his loved ones in the war. As discussed in Chapter 1, this resulted in
clouding of his judgement and led to his questions and doubts about duty,
knowledge etc. Lord Krishna states in this verse that Arjuna would
overcome his ignorance by understanding Krishna’s teaching which would
convince him that everyone is controlled, protected, and pervaded by the
Lord. By using the phrases mayi (within Me) and sarva bhootani (all
beings - plural), the Lord is making it truly clear that He is supreme, and all
beings act under His control. This is one of the core concepts of the
philosophy of dualism of Sri Madhwacharya.

Nothing in this world is as pure as (spiritual) knowledge. One who is

(4.38)
Comments: These three verses describe three major benefits from
‘sacrifice of knowledge’ - acquiring and acting on divine, spiritual
knowledge (jnana yagna). In verse 4.36, knowledge is compared to a boat.
Just as one needs a boat to cross a river, similarly one needs proper
knowledge to traverse the river of worldly afflictions. A boat does not row
itself. It needs a sailor. Similarly, mere knowledge is not good enough. One
needs a proper teacher, and one must practice and act upon such
knowledge. In verse 4.37, it is stated that the fire of knowledge burns off
ill-effects of action just as a blazing fire turns wood into ashes. This implies
that knowledge should be sharp, strong, and powerful, just like a blazing
fire. Verse 4.38 categorically states that such knowledge is superior to

138

everything else in this world, and one must diligently pursue the path of
learning to acquire this knowledge over time.

Comments: Arjuna had developed deep doubts about the need to
fight the war based on his fears of losing near and dear ones. Lord Krishna
concludes the discussion in this chapter by encouraging Arjuna to get rid of
the doubts in his mind through proper knowledge and focus on his
prescribed duty of waging the rightful war with proper conviction.
Summary of Chapter 4
In chapter 3, the Lord taught that one must perform one’s prescribed
duties without expectations. In this chapter, the Lord teaches more about
the nature of activities (karma) of both the Lord and individual beings. In
verses 4.1-3, the Lord says that He had taught this spiritual knowledge
previously to deities such as Surya etc. In response to Arjuna’s question in

140

The Bhagavad Gita

4.4 about the chronology of the Lord’s current manifestation and those of
other deities, the Lord provides details of His incarnations in 4.5-9 stating
that He manifests at His own free will from time to time to protect
righteousness and virtue in society and to destroy evil. In verse 4.13, the
Lord discusses the creation of living beings based on one’s innate nature,
aptitude, and activities. In verse 4.14, the Lord states that He has no
obligations and activities do not bind Him. He states that one who clearly
understands the distinction between the supreme soul and individual souls
will not be entangled by actions. Categories and nature of activities are
described in verses 4.16-33 which provide comparison of nishkama karma
to other types of activities (karma), and details of the types of nishkama
karma. Verses 4.16 to 4.18, compare the different types of activities –
karma (right action), vikarma (prohibited action), and akarma (inaction).
Verse 4.18 describes the two attributes of one who is performing one’s duty
perfectly– (i) such a person realizes that even when performing prescribed
duties, the actual work is being enabled by the Lord himself and (ii) when
not actively performing duties, (ex: during sleep, dream) activity such as
breathing is enabled by the Lord. Such a wise person will derive full
benefits from duties performed. In that sense verse 4.18 is a summary of
this entire chapter. Five verses (4.19- 23) describe the characteristics of
such a wise person, which briefly are – pandit (highly knowledgeable), ever
contented, detached, equanimous. That person would also have deep
conviction in divine, spiritual knowledge. Verses 4.24-30 contain a
discussion on different types of sacrifices performed by seekers in their
quest for self-realization and liberation. These verses emphatically state
that Vedic sacrifice (yagna) not only refers to the symbolic acts of
propitiating deities with fire rituals etc., but also refers to other selfless acts
such as donating to charity, devotional worship to the Lord Almighty,
spiritual education, self-control, self-discipline etc. The discussion on
sacrifices is concluded in verse 4.32 where the Lord exhorts Arjuna to fight
the just war to protect his citizens as that is his prescribed duty. Performing

Chapter 4

141

one’s prescribed duty as an offering to the Lord is indeed a superior form of
worshipping the Lord. In verse 4.33, the Lord teaches that action is
complete only when it is accompanied by knowledge. In verses 4.36-38, the
Lord describes the greatness of knowledge and in verse 4.39 outlines the
attributes of a seeker searching for right knowledge. This chapter is
concluded in verse 4.42, where Lord Krishna exhorts Arjuna to use
knowledge (jnana) to get over any doubts he had about waging the war and
to focus on fighting the just war with conviction.

Chapter 5 - The Path of Renunciation
Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 29 verses is known as
Sanyasa Yoga (The Path of Renunciation). Renunciation of worldly
pleasures is termed sanyasa and performing prescribed duties as an offering
to the Lord is termed yoga (action). In this chapter, the Lord answers
Arjuna’s questions on fundamental aspects of these two concepts – sanyasa
and yoga. Arjuna’s argument is that if renunciation were a better option
than action, he could perhaps adopt the life of an ascetic and avoid waging
the war. The Lord goes on to describe the characteristics of a renunciant
and clarifies that one must incorporate both these paths to achieve selfrealization. The Lord reiterates that Arjuna must focus on performing his
prescribed duty of waging the war to protect his citizens from the evil
Kauravas. This chapter also delves into the importance of detachment and
the characteristics of seekers who have developed detachment from
rewards through self-control.
Action or Renunciation? Which is Better?

Arjuna said: O Krishna! Sometimes you seem to praise the path of
renunciation and other times you seem to praise the path of action. Please
tell me clearly, which of the two is beneficial. (5.1)
Comments: In verse 2.48, the Lord clearly directs Arjuna to focus
on his prescribed duties without expectations. This concept was expanded
in Chapter 3 (karma yoga). In verse 4.22, from Chapter 4 (jnana yoga), the
Lord stated that one must be equanimous in the face of happiness/sadness
and be content with whatever is granted by Him. These two characteristics

Chapter 5

143

are described by ‘yoga’ and ‘sanyasa’. If the latter is the better path, then
Arjuna could conclude that he would be better off focusing on
relinquishing all activities and developing equanimity and devotion to the
Lord. He could then perhaps avoid participating in the destructive war.
Sri Rayaru in GV gives us a second interpretation, where the
question is related to the comparison between ascetics and householders.
Verse 4.41 can be interpreted as describing the attribute of a seeker who
has relinquished all outcomes from actions and has taken on the role of an
ascetic. Verse 4.42 directs that one must perform one’s prescribed duties
and hence can be interpreted as referring to a householder. So, Arjuna
could also be enquiring about the comparison between an ascetic and a
householder, and if the former were the better of the two, he could perhaps
embrace ascetism and avoid the battle.
Action and Renunciation - Both required for Liberation

The Lord said: Renunciation of worldly pleasures (sanyasa) and
performing prescribed duties (yoga) are both necessary for one to achieve
liberation. Performing prescribed action is better than merely renouncing
worldly pleasures. (5.2)
Comments: The Lord categorically states that both–renunciation of
worldly pleasures (sanyasa) and performing prescribed duties as an
offering to Him (karma yoga) are necessary for one to achieve
self-realization and liberation. One cannot conclude that only ascetics
practice detachment and they do not have any obligations on action. Nor do
householders only practice prescribed activities without practicing
self-control. So, one cannot argue that sanyasa and karma yoga cannot
co-exist in the same person. Lord Krishna recognizes Arjuna’s motivation

144

The Bhagavad Gita

in this question and states that performing prescribed duties as an offering
to the Lord (karma yoga) is superior to mere detachment, equanimity etc.
(sanyasa), but both are required for achieving self-realization and ultimate
liberation. Again, the Lord is impressing upon Arjuna that he must not
avoid participating in his prescribed duty of fighting the just war.

One who neither hates the unpleasant nor craves for the pleasant is a

conquered dualities (such as hatred and desires) will be freed from
bondage. (5.3)
Comments: This verse clarifies that renunciation is not an attribute
of only ascetics. Sri Rayaru [GV] states that in verse 4.22, the Lord
described the attributes of one who has renounced, but without using the
term sanyasa. Here He clarifies that such a person is a sanyasi (renunciant).
This is important because Arjuna, in his question in 5.1 had used the term
sanyasa.

Ignorant people say that the path of knowledge and the path of action
(performed as an offering to the Lord without expectation of outcome) are
different and are not causally related. Learned ones do not say that.
Whichever path is properly followed, it will lead to the results obtainable
from both the paths. (5.4)
Comments: The Lord clarifies that the paths of knowledge and
action are not exclusive but are in fact causally related (i.e. complement
each other). Some scriptures such as the Bhagavata Maha Purana [BMP],
in canto 11, chapter 21, state that those who focus only on ritualistic fire

Chapter 5

145

sacrifices will only end up with irritation in the eyes due to smoke (in other
words they do not achieve anything of value). Sri Rayaru in [GV] clarifies
that the reference in BMP is related to someone who performs ritualistic
activities with expectations on rewards and without offering the fruits to the
Lord. Such activities are pointless. In summary, both the paths of
renunciation and action are complementing each other and result in a
seeker achieving divine, spiritual knowledge.

Those following the path of action (performed as an offering to the

(acquiring and disseminating spiritual knowledge) both reach the Lord’s
abode. The one who understands this is a true knower. (5.5)
Comments: The previous verse stated that both the paths of
knowledge and action are important. How can one deduce that actions lead
to knowledge? The Lord answers by stating that even those in the path of
action do reach the His abode but through the path of divine, spiritual
knowledge. These two paths are symbiotically related. Sri Rayaru in GV
states a second interpretation of this verse as follows – The goal that is
attained by a seeker who is an ascetic is also reachable by seekers who are
householders (non-ascetics). Ascetics who have renounced everything will
also perform activities, and householders act based on knowledge acquired.

performs prescribed action as an offering to the Lord while renouncing
worldly pleasures will indeed reach the Lord. (5.6)
Comments: In this verse the Lord clarifies that mere renunciation of
worldly pleasures while abdicating prescribed duties leads one to downfall.
Developing detachment from rewards requires a lot of mental effort. Such
efforts should not be wasted for temporary rewards. In addition to
renouncing worldly pleasures, one must focus on performing one’s
prescribed duties as an offering to the Lord as this leads to liberation and
lasting peace. On the other hand, a seeker who performs prescribed actions
without attachment to the rewards, but as an offering to the Lord will
indeed reach the Lord’s abode. The goal of every action should be to please
the Lord.

Comments: In verse 5.3, it was stated that a renunciant will not
avoid unpleasant actions and will not crave for only pleasant activities. The
first part of this verse states that the renunciant would have developed this
conviction through the practice of self-control. The second part of this
verse states that such a person will have achieved divine, spiritual
knowledge as a secondary benefit which will then help in obtaining the
primary benefit of moksha.

no one can perform anything independently without the Lord’s will. (5.8)
(5.9)
Comments: Verses (5.3) – (5.7) described the attributes of a
renunciant. These two verses describe the conviction behind those
attributes. One who utterly understands that every action performed
through ones physical body and mind takes place only because of the
Lord’s will can develop detachment from the rewards of any action. After
all such a person knows that no one can perform any action independently,
and in such a case no can one claim any rewards.

The one who performs prescribed duties without expectations, as an

Comments: In verse 5.6, it was stated that a seeker needs both
renunciation and action to achieve self-realization. In verse 5.7, it was
stated that such a seeker will not be tainted by actions. This verse combines
the concepts in these verses and categorically states that such a seeker will
not be impacted by any sins accruing from actions and will obtain moksha.
This verse identifies the attributes of such a seeker who has incorporated
both renunciation and action. Such a seeker –

148

The Bhagavad Gita

is aware that the Lord has caused these activities for the benefit of
the seeker.

Such a seeker is not impacted by any effects of such action, just as
water does not cling to a lotus leaf. The comparison with the lotus is very
apt. The lotus is hydrophobic as even when it is immersed in water, it does
not hold water. Similarly, the seeker described here, even when immersed
in worldly activities will not be tainted by any effects of such actions.
This verse has been appropriately identified by Sri Madinur Vishnu
Teertha as a summary of chapter 5 in BGS as it truly summarizes the
characteristics of a seeker whose spiritual journey incorporates both karma
and sanyasa.

Comments: In previous verses 5-6 to 5-10 it was stated that a seeker
needs to incorporate both renunciation and action to succeed in the path of
self-realization. This verse clarifies that actions must be accompanied by
purity in body, mind, intellect, and sense organs all of which are essential
for any activity. Such a seeker can cleanse his mind. A pure mind can
absorb divine, spiritual concepts easily, which then allows the seeker to
perform prescribed activities without getting entangled by them.

Comments: The previous verses 5-6 to 5-10 discussed the need to
practice both renunciation and prescribed duties (action) to achieve eternal
bliss (moksha). Are there other ways for one to achieve moksha? This verse
clarifies that there are no other ways. These two paths are both necessary to
achieve moksha. One who fails to practice either will develop obsession
with temporary, worldly rewards and will never be able to escape from the
cycle of samsara.

True happiness is experienced by those who completely surrender to

Comments: In verses 5-8 to 5-9, it was stated that a true seeker is
aware that none of the actions performed by that seeker are independently
performed. They are in fact performed by the Lord, using the seeker as an
instrument. This verse clarifies that such a seeker also needs to be aware
that the seeker also cannot cause those actions to be performed
independently. The Lord is responsible for all activities which are
performed by Him of His own free will. Such a seeker even when residing
in a physical body having nine orifices (like nine doors to a city) will
experience peace and will not be tainted by any activities.

150

The Bhagavad Gita

Sri Vidyasagara Madhava Teertha gives an example of an episode in
the Mahabharata, where the city of Dwaravati which had nine doors was
compared to a human body which has nine orifices. When some indulge in
prohibited activities such as gambling, the in-dwelling Lord chooses not to
protect them, just like Lord Krishna did not protect the Pandavas who lost
their kingdom to the Kauravas in the game of dice.

A living being cannot perform activities independently or get
activities performed by others nor achieve fruits from such actions nor get

for all these actions. (5.14)
Living beings cannot independently diminish sins nor claim credit
for good deeds. Their knowledge is veiled by ignorance, and hence they are
deluded. Being deluded, they cannot realize the Lord. (5.15)
Comments: Verses 5.8&5.9 state that living beings, when they interact
with the external world (through actions such as seeing, talking) are not
actually doing so on their own. These two verses provide more insight into
the nature of actions as they relate to living beings. Sri Rayaru in GV
provides two interpretations for these verses depending on the attribution
for the words ‘prabhu’ in 5.14 and ‘vibhu’ in 5.15, both of which mean the
Lord. These two words can be either attributed to jiva, the individual soul
(as it is superior to inert objects) as also to the Lord Almighty (who is the
Lord of all).

Chapter 5

151

 Individual Souls: The first half of the verse 5.14 states that individual
souls cannot act on their own or can they cause action by someone
else. How about the reward for actions performed, regardless of how
they are performed? The second half of the verse (5.14) answers by
stating that individuals also do not have independence on the issue of
rewards. The first half of 5.15 states that individual souls do not
accrue negative or positive effects of action on their own. If the Lord
is responsible for all actions, why is it that no one can physically see
the Lord? The second half of 5.15 states that individuals cannot see
the Lord as they are covered by ignorance.
 Lord Almighty: The Lord has not granted individuals, ability to act
on their own. Likewise, the Lord has also not granted individuals, the
liberty to claim rewards for their actions on their own. If the Lord is
responsible for all actions of the individuals, will the Lord not be
tainted by such actions? The first half of 5.15 states that the Lord is
not tainted by actions of the individuals. The Lord provides
individuals apparatus and facilities to act based on the individuals’
innate nature to help them in their spiritual journey.
There are several questions that arise at this stage regarding the nature
of actions related to an individual soul, inert objects, and the Lord. These
questions are summarized as follows:
 If an individual soul does not have independence in performing
actions, how can that soul be held responsible for the consequences
of such actions?
 If the Lord Almighty is the one who is independent and is
responsible for all actions performed by individual souls, how can
the Lord be immune from the effects of such actions?
Sri Madhwacharya in his commentary on the Brahma Sutras [BSB]
and in other works such as GTN, adequately answers these questions.

152

The Bhagavad Gita

Firstly, one must understand the nature of attributes, doership (doer is an
entity that performs some action) and independence as they relate to the
three entities in the universe namely, individual souls, inert objects, and the
Lord Almighty.
Attribute\Entity
Doership
Independence

Inert Objects
No
No

Individual Souls Lord Almighty
Yes
Yes
No
Yes

The Lord is independent in all aspects and has unlimited ability to
perform activities independently. Hence, He has both doership and
independence. Inert objects neither have ability to perform anything nor do
they have independence. Individual souls do have doership but not
independence, hence they have dependent doership. The relationship
between the Lord, inert objects and living beings is illustrated with the
example of a dairy farmer milking a cow through its udders in Sri
Madhwacharya’s GTN 3-33. All three entities are required in the task of
extracting milk from a cow. The udder is akin to an inert object. It cannot
act, nor does it have any awareness or intent. The cow is a living being. It
has awareness, it produces milk, it has an intention to give milk, but it
cannot independently extract milk from itself. The dairy farmer is like the
Lord who uses the udder and extracts milk from the cow.
Armed with the above information, the two questions raised can be
answered as follows:
 Individual souls also have the quality of doership, but they are not
independent. The Lord grants individuals the ability to perform
activities based on their innate intent (iccha), attempt (prayatna) and
knowledge (jnana). After all everyone has an intent to achieve
liberation. The Lord recognizes this intent and grants the souls
facilities such as a physical body, mind, intellect and sense organs to
attain knowledge and perform prescribed duties. Even though
individual souls do not have independence in action, they do have
responsibility for their actions and hence are subject to dos and

Chapter 5

153

don’ts (vidhi, nishedha). The key here is the intent that is present in
individual souls. This concept is clarified in Brahma Sutra (2.3.47).
 The Lord is not tainted by actions performed by individual souls as
the Lord merely grants them the ability to perform such actions. The
Lord has nothing to gain by providing individual souls with the
facilities they need. He does so out of pure compassion.
With the above information one can also resolve apparent conflicts in
spiritual texts where in some texts individual souls are described as not
having the attribute of doership, while in other texts the individual souls are
described as having the attribute of doership. The former is indicating that
the doership is not independent and the latter is indicating that the doership
is dependent.

For those whose ignorance is destroyed by proper knowledge about
the Lord, that very knowledge will reveal the Supreme Lord to them like a
brilliant sun. (5.16)
Comments: The previous verse 5.15 indicated that the limitations of
individual beings are due to their knowledge enveloped by ignorance. This
verse clarifies how such ignorance can be overcome. If one’s innate
knowledge is covered by ignorance, how can that person be convinced to
perform prescribed duties (yoga) with detachment (sanyasa)? Sri Rayaru in
GV explains that knowledge that is enveloped by ignorance is the innate
knowledge (swaroopa jnana) that is specific to a soul. The ignorance can
be removed by the seeker obtaining proper knowledge through scriptural
studies and teachings from a Guru. This knowledge is termed ‘paroksha’
(indirect). Thus, a seeker by obtaining paroksha knowledge can get rid of
ignorance, perform prescribed duties with detachment and attain divine,
spiritual (aparoksha or direct) knowledge and reach the Lord.

Comments: Verse 5.16 states that a seeker must acquire indirect
knowledge through scriptural studies, to destroy ignorance which leads to
acquiring divine, spiritual knowledge that eventually leads to moksha. This
verse clarifies that one cannot expect to acquire direct knowledge
(aparoksha) immediately after acquiring indirect knowledge. One must
repeatedly study scriptures with the mind fully immersed in the Lord and
ensure that the knowledge acquired is without any doubts and develop full
conviction in such knowledge. This will allow a seeker to be prepared to
absorb direct, divine, spiritual knowledge which leads the seeker to
moksha.

(5.18)
Comments: Previous verses 5.16 and 5.17 stated that a seeker must
first acquire indirect knowledge through scriptural studies. When is a
seeker considered to have obtained that knowledge? This verse states that a
seeker who has successfully acquired indirect knowledge will know that the

Chapter 5

same Lord Almighty is present everywhere and in everyone. They will

without explicit mention. In this verse, it is clarified that the attribution
Sama is to the Lord only, as evidenced by the adjective in the second line,
nirdosham (one who is devoid of any blemishes). Sri Rayaru explains this
in GV.

Comments: This verse describes additional attributes of seekers who
have successfully acquired spiritual knowledge. Such seekers will exhibit
equanimity in the presence of pleasure or pain. They are no longer
enveloped by ignorance and are aware of the independent nature of the
Lord Almighty.

One who has withdrawn from attachment to sense pleasures through
external objects will experience inner bliss, although temporarily.
Permanent bliss is experienced only through meditation, by focusing the
mind steadfastly on the Lord. (5.21)
Comments: Verse 5.6 states that mere renunciation of worldly
pleasures while abdicating actions is pointless. However, one can argue that
by practising detachment from sense pleasures, one can overcome desires
and experience peace. In this case, why perform any specific activities?
This verse states that any peace that is attained by withdrawal from
attachment to sense pleasures is temporary. To experience unlimited bliss,
one must also focus on performing activities such as meditation with the
mind steadfastly focused on the Lord. This verse uses the term akshaya
meaning ‘unlimited’ in the second line. The procedure for meditation is
described later in the verses 5.27 and 5.28. Sri Rayaru has a second
interpretation for this verse as follows: A renunciant will experience some
amount of bliss just by remembering the Lord. It goes without saying that
when renunciation is coupled with deep meditation on the Lord, the seeker
will be on the path to achieve moksha (unending bliss).

sense activities? This verse answers by stating that the learned ones are
aware that such activities, while they appear to bring pleasure in the short
term, always end up in misery (for example, the long term health effects of
indulging in excessive sweet dishes). The reason for such misery is due to
the transitory nature of the pleasure experienced.

One who can withstand the pressures of desire and anger in this
lifetime, before leaving their body, is the real yogi. Such a person is indeed
blissful. (5.23)
Comments: This verse urges a seeker to develop detachment from
emotions such as desire, anger, etc., in the current lifetime itself. Sri Rayaru
clarifies in GV the importance for a seeker to develop such detachment in
the current lifetime while the seeker has a human form. There is no
guarantee that one will be reborn in human form. It is not easy for other
living forms, such as animals, to develop such detachment. Hence, one
should not waste the opportunity that the Lord has provided by granting
one a human form. Sri Padmanabha Teertha, in his commentary Gita
Bhashya Bhava Pradeepika [GBBP] clarifies that the use of the word
nara (human) in this verse does not imply that only humans are eligible for
bliss. Those who have attained Brahma Loka (the abode of Brahma) are
also eligible for bliss as they do not have emotions of desire, anger, etc. Sri
Madhwacharya in his GB, clarifies that one reaches Brahma Loka only
after overcoming such emotions.

The Bhagavad Gita

A yogi who has realised the futility of seeking pleasures from the
external world will experience inner bliss and will realise Lord Almighty.
Such a person who is truly knowledgeable about the true nature of the Lord
will indeed reach the Lord’s abode. (5.24)
Comments: The next few verses describe the nature of the learned.
They experience bliss on two counts. Firstly, by overcoming passions such
as desire and aversion, they feel liberated. Second, by focusing on the Lord
in their minds, they experience inner bliss. They are focused only on the
Lord and nothing else, as indicated by the use of the word eva (only) in the
first line. The Lord here is described as anatarjyoti meaning the one who is
self-effulgent.

Lord will achieve inner bliss. This verse further stated that such a seeker
who is rid of sins will rise above duality (such as joy/misery), exercise selfcontrol, and have strong convictions in spiritual knowledge. Such a
conviction occurs once a seeker is devoid of any doubts or ignorance about
spiritual issues.

indeed liberated in this very life. (5.27) (5.28)
Comments: Verse 5.21 indicated the need for meditation. These two
verses describe the procedure for meditation on the Lord. Meditation
involves three main steps. The first step is to withdraw sense organs from
indulging in pursuing sensory pleasures. The second step is to control
breathing by holding the breath steady after inhalation and exhalation. The
third step is to focus the eyes on the region between the eyebrows or the
edge of the nose. These steps help a seeker maintain physical and mental
steadiness, which allows the mind to concentrate on the Lord. Such a
seeker is deemed to have achieved liberation in this very life. In other
words, such a seeker will indeed achieve liberation hereafter.

The Bhagavad Gita

One who meditates on Me and knows Me as the ultimate consumer
of all sacrifices and rituals, as the Supreme Lord of the universe and as the
well-wisher for all beings, will indeed reach Me and will be liberated.
(5.29)
Comments: The previous two verses described the process of
concentrated meditation on the Lord. The above verse describes the subject
of such meditation, namely Lord Almighty.
Summary of Chapter 5
In chapter 3, the Lord taught that one must perform ones prescribed
duties without expectations. (nishkama karma). In chapter 4, the Lord
imparts knowledge (jnana) about the nature of activities (karma) of both
the Lord and individual beings. In chapter 5, the Lord answers some
fundamental questions from Arjuna (5.1) regarding the concepts of
renunciation (sanyasa) and action (karma). It is apparent from Arjuna’s
question that if renunciation were a better option than action, he could
perhaps adopt the life of an ascetic and avoid waging the war. The Lord
answers (5.2) by stating that while both the paths of renunciation and action
lead one to liberation, the path of action is superior. The Lord goes on to
describe the characteristics of a renunciant (5.2) and clarifies that one must
incorporate both these paths to achieve self-realization (5.6). An oft quoted
example is that of a person who is sick in the stomach due to an unhealthy
diet. For such a person to heal, it is important to both consume the
medication prescribed by the doctor and at the same time avoid indulging
in an unhealthy diet. By stating that the path of action is superior, the Lord
is clarifying to Arjuna that he must participate in his prescribed duty of
waging this war to protect his citizens, while detaching himself from any
outcomes of his actions. The Lord also clarifies that both ascetics and
householders are equally eligible to attain salvation, based on their efforts.
An ascetic who may have acquired divine, spiritual knowledge will still be
involved in performing activities and likewise a householder who is
preoccupied with performing prescribed activities will also be involved in
acquiring spiritual knowledge. Some scriptures downplay the role of

Chapter 5

161

actions such as ritual fire sacrifices which may only result in eye irritation,
due to smoke. It is clarified that any such description of action is related to
actions that are performed with specific expectations. They do not apply to
actions performed as an offering to the Lord without expectations (5.4). It
is also clarified that one cannot achieve much by merely relinquishing the
outcomes of actions, without offering them to the Lord. Any activity can be
deemed as complete and useful only when such activities are performed
with a pure mind and as an offering to the Lord with no material
expectations (5.6). An ideal seeker is one who performs prescribed duties
with detachment towards the rewards, performs activities while exercising
control over sense organs and the mind, knows that the Lord is the one who
is causing the action, and is aware that the Lord Almighty is the Lord of
everyone in the universe. He performs activities with devotion and as a
worship to the Lord. Such a seeker will not be tainted by any effects of
actions just as water does not stick to a lotus leaf (5.10). One should realize
that it is the Lord who makes it possible for one to perform any activity.
The Lord activates all activities in the universe. However, the individual
souls are responsible for the outcomes of their activities, even though they
are enabled to act by the Lord. The individual soul has dependent doership
and the Lord is the only independent doer. The Lord activates the intent and
attempt of the individual souls, hence the individual souls are held
responsible for the actions. The Lord is never tainted by any such actions,
as He has nothing to gain by any action and performs them out of pure
compassion for the individual souls (5-14, 5-15). The nature of knowledge
in learned ones is described in verses 5.15 to 5.17. Knowledge is of two
types, indirect and direct. The inherent knowledge in individual souls is
masked by ignorance, and seekers get rid of this ignorance through spiritual
studies, analysis, and listening to lectures from teachers (indirect
knowledge) etc. This paves the way for seekers to achieve self-realization
(direct knowledge). Learned ones perceive the same blemishless Lord full
of infinite auspicious attributes present in all living beings (5.18). Learned
ones who have developed detachment from sense pleasure, experience
peace due to a sense of liberation, but everlasting bliss is only possible
through meditation with the mind focused exclusively on the Lord (5.12).

162

The Bhagavad Gita

Learned ones avoid indulging in sense pleasures which are temporary and
lead only to misery (5.22). The Lord exhorts one to develop control over
sense organs and emotions such as desire, anger in one’s current lifetime
itself while one has a human form, as this will not be possible with other
life forms (5.23). The procedure for performing concentrated meditation
which was stated as a necessity in verse 5.21 is described in verses 5.27 and
5.28. The chapter is concluded in 5.29 which describes the characteristics
of the Lord who is the goal of such meditation. A seeker who meditates on
the Lord, knowing the Lord as the consumer of all sacrifices and rituals, as
the Lord of all, and as one who is the well-wisher for everyone, will indeed
achieve liberation.

Chapter 6 - The Path of Self Restraint
Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 47 verses is termed Atma
Samyama Yoga (The Path of Self Restraint) or Dhyana Yoga (The Path of
Meditation). The previous chapters described the broad contours of the path
of action (karma yoga) and the path of knowledge (jnana yoga). Further,
the characteristics of a seeker who is on a journey to self-realization were
broadly identified as one having detachment from outcomes of action
(sanyasa) and performing prescribed duties (yoga) as an offering to the
Lord. This was briefly described in verse 2.39. Yoga as described here
prepares a seeker to learn more about the greatness of the Lord which is
covered in detail in chapters 7 to 12. This chapter delves more into the
details of yoga (action) and its components. Yoga has two components –
external and internal. The external component of yoga refers to the
prescribed activities that one must perform that are visible to others. For
example, Arjuna waging the war to protect his citizens from the Kauravas’
misrule. This aspect of yoga was briefly described in verse 2.45 and was
expanded in chapters 3 to 5. The internal component of yoga is termed
dhyana yoga (path of meditation), This is also an essential aspect of yoga
and was briefly described in verse 5.27. This chapter delves into details of
dhyana yoga. Characteristics of a true yogi are described. The physical
aspects of meditation such as place, physical pose, breath control etc., are
also described. Requirements for moderation in consumption are also
discussed. To a question from Arjuna regarding the condition of those who
make a sincere attempt but are not able to successfully implement karma
and dhyana, the Lord teaches that no sincere effort is a waste, and such
seekers will get additional opportunities to complete their spiritual journey.

The Lord said: One who performs prescribed duties without
expectations is both a real ascetic and a real yogi; not the one who has
simply relinquished performing ritual fire sacrifices. (6.1).
Comments: As indicated before, this chapter delves into details of
dhyana yoga, or the internal component of yoga (path of action). When is a
seeker eligible to follow the path of dhyana (meditation) which prepares
one to learn about the qualities of the Lord? This verse states that a true
seeker who has both detachment towards outcomes of actions and
commitment to performing prescribed duties is ready and eligible for
dhyana yoga.
Some schools such as sankhya, hold the view that ascetics who have
relinquished ritual fire sacrifices are the only ones eligible for dhyana yoga.
This verse clarifies that even ascetics have obligations to perform
sacrifices such as worship of the Lord, learning and preaching scriptures
etc., as was stated in verse 4.25. Hence all seekers (including ascetics, and
householders) are eligible for dhyana yoga if they perform their prescribed
duties without expectations.

O Pandava (Arjuna)! Understand that relinquishing passions such as
desire and anger (detachment) is an integral part of karma yoga. One who
is performing activities without getting rid of desire is not a real yogi. (6.2)

Chapter 6

165

Comments: Previous verses stated that a real seeker has both the
characteristics of detachment from outcomes and commitment to
performing prescribed activities, which are broadly termed sanyasa and
yoga. To emphasize the fact that these are not separate paths, this verse
explicitly states that sanyasa as described here is an essential component of
yoga.

For the one who has indirect knowledge (through scriptures) of the
Lord, the path of achieving direct, divine knowledge is through the path of
action. One who has achieved direct knowledge of the Lord, through
steadfast prayer and meditation, will experience exuberance in bliss upon
liberation. (6.3)
Comments: Knowledge is of two types. Indirect knowledge
(paroksha jnana) is the knowledge that a seeker acquires through study of
scriptures, from listening to teachers etc. This knowledge helps the seeker
to get rid of ignorance that covers innate knowledge (verse 5.16). A seeker
armed with such indirect knowledge, by practicing sanyasa and yoga, will
be eligible for self-realization through direct, divine knowledge (aparoksha
jnana). Will an aparoksha jnani indulge in activities and if so, what is to be
gained? This verse builds upon the description in verse 3.20 and clarifies
that an aparoksha jnani continues to perform activities to set an example to
the society. Such actions are not wasted efforts but will result in increased
exuberance in bliss upon liberation. There is another difference in duties
performed by paroksha and aparoksha jnanis. The former needs to also
engage in service to society to help those in need (just as one needs to pay
taxes). The latter does not have such a broad mandate but needs to serve
superior souls.

One who is naturally disinterested in sense pleasures, has no

Comments: This verse describes the characteristics of a realized
soul (aparoksha jnani) who has attained direct, divine knowledge. Such a
person is said to be naturally disinterested in sense pleasures and in rewards
from actions. This is different from other seekers who are yet to reach this
stage. These other seekers may also have developed aversion to sense
pleasures, but such aversion does not come to them naturally. They must
actively practice control of sense organs.
The Mind is a Friend and an Enemy

One should elevate oneself through the mind and should never fall
into misery because of a weak mind. The mind is one’s friend and is also
one’s enemy. (6.5)
Comments: The next few verses describe the role of the mind in a
seeker’s evolution. The specialty of this verse is that it has 7 repetitions of
the word ‘atma’. This is a remarkably interesting word in Sanskrit that has
different meanings such as – self, Lord Almighty, mind, intellect, devotion
etc. One can decipher the actual meaning only by looking at the context in
which this word is used. The above translation interprets the 7 occurrences
of atma as one, oneself, mind, mind, mind, one and mind.
Sri Rayaru [GV] provides an alternate meaning of this verse by
interpreting atma as the Lord Almighty in some places. The Lord is ones

Chapter 6

167

friend and the Lord is also one’s enemy. Hence, one must strive to earn the
Lord’s grace and one must avoid earning His wrath.

For one who wins over the mind with the intellect, the mind is
indeed a friend. For one who cannot win over the mind, it becomes an
enemy (the Lord becomes a friend to the devoted, and an enemy to those
not devoted). (6.6)
Comments: This verse provides the reason for the mind to be
someone’s friend or enemy. For one who has developed control over the
mind using the intellect, the mind is a friend. For such a seeker, the mind is
a fertile ground for performing concentrated meditation on the Lord. For
one who has no control over the mind, the mind itself becomes an enemy.
So, the mind is like a key, which can be used to both lock and open a door.
A second interpretation as per Sri Rayaru in GV is as follows: For a
seeker who has won over the Lord through devotion, the Lord becomes a
friend. Those who are not devoted to the Lord will have the Lord as their
enemy. In the above two interpretations the word ‘atma’ has been
translated as intellect and devotion, respectively.

study of scriptures etc.) and special, direct, divine knowledge. This seeker
is exemplified by contentment, detachment from sense pleasures, is
equipoised when facing extreme conditions such as cold/heat, praise/insult,
happiness/sadness etc. The seeker also treats mud, stone, and gold equally
and is indeed the real yogi (6.7) (6.8)
Comments: Previous verses indicated that the mind and the Lord
Almighty can be both friends and enemies. For a learned one who has won
over both the mind (through intellect) and the Lord (through devotion), the
Lord is a friend. These two verses describe the effect felt by such a seeker.
With the Lord manifesting in the heart of such a seeker (in other words
through the grace of the Lord), the seeker will develop great patience and
equanimity in the face of extreme cold/heat, praise/insult etc. By acquiring
knowledge through spiritual studies (indirect knowledge), a seeker
develops control over sense organs/mind and devotion to the Lord, which
in turn allows the seeker to win over the mind as well as the Lord. This
allows the seeker to realize the Lord (direct knowledge), which in turn
equips the seeker with equanimity in the face of extreme situations.

Such a person treats everyone – well-wishers, friends, enemies,
casual acquaintances, middlemen, the hateful, family along with virtuous
people, and sinners equally. Equality is in the sense that the same
blemishless Lord full of infinite auspicious attributes is indwelling in
everyone. (6.9)
Comments: This verse continues to describe important attributes of a
seeker who has achieved self-realization (with direct, divine knowledge).
The population that one deals with daily is categorized into seven types -

Chapter 6









169

Well-wishers: Those who help others unconditionally
Friends: Those who go out of their way to save others from danger
Enemies: Those who always harm others
Casual acquaintances: Those who neither help nor hurt.
Middlemen: Those who help sometimes and harm sometimes
Hateful: Those who hate others
Family: Those who only help.

Everyone comes across these types of people daily and a real yogi treats
them fairly and equally according to the guidelines in the scriptures.
Equality is recognizing that the Lord indwelling in everyone is equally
supreme with infinite auspicious attributes without blemish.

Comments: In verse 5.27, the procedure for performing meditation
was briefly discussed. The next few verses provide more details on
meditation. To properly perform meditation, one must focus on three
aspects, mental, physical, and respiratory. The most difficult aspect to
control among these three is of course, the mental aspect. Hence, there has
been more emphasis on the importance of controlling one’s mind. A yogi
engaged in meditation first finds a suitable, calm place to minimize
distractions from the external world.

For meditation, a seeker should choose a clean place and make a firm
seat which is neither too high nor too low. The seat should be made of three
layers starting with kusa grass, soft animal skin and a clean, soft cloth on
top. (6.11)
On this seat, the seeker should sit comfortably but firmly (with one
of the yoga poses such as the lotus, the diamond etc.), with due control over
body and mind, and start meditation on the Lord for self-purification. (6.12)
Comments: For concentrated meditation, it is necessary to observe
personal cleanliness and cleanliness of the environment. For one to ensure a
clear mind and focus on the Lord Almighty, it is important to ensure
physical cleanliness.

With a clear, uncluttered mind, devoid of any fears from external
elements, focusing the mind on the Lord, keeping the sense organs from
straying, a seeker should meditate on Me (Lord Krishna) with firm
conviction in My supremacy. (6.14)

Chapter 6

171

Comments: After preparing the physical apparatus (space, seat etc.),
the seeker is now ready to start meditation, observing physical discipline by
keeping body, head, and neck straight. It is also important to be free from
fears from external elements such as wild animals when performing
meditation. The Lord also says that the seeker should observe
brahmacharya which some interpret as celibacy. However, meditation
applies to all, not just the unmarried. So, the real interpretation of the
brahmachari is brahma + achara, the one whose mind is active only on
topics related to the Lord (brahma).

who performs concentrated meditation on the Lord, based on the
procedures described previously. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that such a
seeker will not just achieve the state of jeevan mukti (inner bliss
experienced while alive) but will also achieve everlasting bliss in the
company of the Lord in moksha.

O Arjuna! One cannot achieve benefits of such meditation if one
over eats or does not eat at all. Similarly, one who oversleeps or does not
sleep at all, will also lose all benefits from meditation. (6.16)
One who wishes to benefit from such meditation should practice
moderation in eating, relaxing, sleeping, and other daily activities. (6.17)
Comments: These two verses describe the requirements for physical
wellbeing for a seeker to successfully perform concentrated meditation. It
is important for a seeker to ensure physical wellbeing by observing
moderation in habits such as eating, sleeping etc. It is evident from practice
that overeating leads to bodily discomfort. Similarly, oversleeping leads to
laziness and lethargy. Neither of these conditions are conducive for
meditation. Likewise, one should not unnecessarily indulge in difficult,
strict fasting (as some do to reduce weight) as this can also have health
consequences. Basically, one needs to observe moderation in eating and
sleeping. However, those who are in good physical condition, should not
avoid fasting on special days such as Ekadashi.

The condition of a person, who can meditate on the Lord with
complete control over the sense organs and the mind, is similar to that of a
lamp glowing steadily in a windless place. (6.19)

173

Comments: One who can observe moderation in habits (6.16),
(6.17), and implement the techniques of meditation described in previous
verses 6.11 – 6.14, will be able to control the sense organs, and mind, and
successfully meditate with the mind focused on the Lord. The state of a
focused mind is compared to that of a lamp in a windless place where the
lamp continues to glow steadily.

One who has reached such a state will experience happiness beyond
the reach of the sense organs that can only be comprehended by the
intellect and will not lead the mind away from the Lord. (6.21)
One who experiences such happiness will not find anything more
valuable and will not panic even in the most challenging situations. (6.22)

The Bhagavad Gita

This path that frees one completely from misery is the real yoga. A
seeker should practice such yoga with mental conviction detached from
worldly pleasures. (6.23)
Comments: These 4 verses describe the experience of a yogi who is
immersed in dhyana, meditation. They are characterized as follows:
 the mind, which is under control, will not seek any outside material.
 the yogi experiences inner bliss by visualizing the Lord within.
 the yogi experiences a level of happiness that cannot be
comprehended by sense organs.
 the mind is focused steadfastly on the Lord and does not stray.
 the yogi does not consider anything else as more valuable.
 the yogi is not impacted by worldly distress.
Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that this state of meditation not only helps a
seeker conquer any existing unhappiness but ensures that the seeker will
not experience unhappiness in future also.

A seeker should resolve to completely renounce activities of sense
pleasure and use the mind to control the sense organs completely. (6.24)
A seeker should strive to bring the mind gradually under the firm
control of the intellect. Having controlled the mind, one should focus
attention on the Lord to the exclusion of all external thoughts, refrain from
chasing sense pleasures, and tightly control the sense organs. (6.25)

Chapter 6

175

Comments: The first action that a seeker must undertake is to make
a resolution to completely renounce indulging in sense pleasures. A seeker
who is serious about traversing the path to liberation should take this first
step. After all, it is common even in worldly life for someone desirous of
achieving somethings to start by making a mental resolution to reach that
goal. The Lord recognizes that it is almost impossible for one to withdraw
the mind away from sense pleasure instantly. Hence, the advice to
implement the process gradually, in steps.

The mind, by nature, is always wandering. As and when the mind
starts straying into worldly matters, the seeker should forcibly bring the
mind back to focus on the Lord. (6.26)
Comments: This verse continues the discussion on mind control.
The mind is ever wandering. The mind also cannot be empty. One way to
ensure that the mind is not filled with worldly matters is to forcibly focus
and fill the mind with issues related to the Lord. This ensures that the mind
will gradually focus on the Lord and move away from worldly matters.

meditation is achievement of superior happiness. A tranquil mind focused
on the Lord can protect itself from the impacts of passionate qualities in

that happiness as the highest bliss that one experiences in the company of

visualized by a yogi practicing dhyana meditation. Verse 5.29 and 6.14

additional attributes in the context of a dhyana yogi.

who performs dhyana meditation using the procedures described
previously. Such a seeker will see the Lord residing in everyone and
everything and will also know the Lord as the controller of everything in
the universe. The Lord will take care of such a seeker who will always be
devoted to Him.

Seekers who see only My presence in all beings and worship Me as
such will ultimately reach My abode regardless of their conditions or state
of being during their lifetime. (6.31)
Comments: This verse discusses additional benefits from dhyana
meditation. A seeker performing such meditation with conviction about the
Lord’s presence in everyone will achieve moksha regardless of whether the
seeker has taken a just or an unjust path. Sri Rayaru clarifies in GV that in
the latter case, the quantity of bliss experienced in moksha will be reduced.
Why do some realized souls take an unjust path? Many times, as in the case
of Bharata and Ajamila, realized souls indulged in undesirable activities
(a result of past action) due to the will of the Lord. But they were
eventually shown the proper path by the Lord and ultimately achieved
moksha. They would however experience a reduction in bliss in moksha.
Sri Padmanabha Teertha in his Gita commentary [GBBP], makes a
reference to verse 3.17 where a realized soul destined for moksha has no
obligations to perform any activities. Such a seeker will also eventually
reach the Lord even if that seeker had not performed any activities.

O Arjuna! One who wishes for others, the same that is wished for
oneself (presence of happiness and absence of sadness) and sees the same

Comments: In this verse the Lord describes the characteristics of a
yogi who is superior to others. Such a seeker will wish for others what the
seeker would have wished for himself/herself and would see the same Lord
in everyone. Does it mean that the yogi will treat or consider everyone as
equal? No. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies. The word sama or equal refers to the
same Lord that is present in everyone as indicated by the phrase ‘ekatvam
asthita’ in the previous verse. The same Lord is present in everyone with
infinite auspicious attributes while being devoid of any blemishes.

Chapter 6

179

Comments: Arjuna, after listening to Krishna’s teachings on dhyana
meditation expresses doubts about the ability of the mind to meditate with
full focus. The mind, by nature is fickle and is always wavering. The mind
is extraordinarily strong, and many times forces one’s body and sense
organs astray. How can one control such a mind? It would be like trying to
capture the wind. These are natural questions that would arise in a seeker.

The Lord said: O Arjuna, One with Strong Arms! No doubt it is
exceedingly difficult to control the wavering mind. O Son of Kunti! It can
be controlled by practice (of dhyana meditation) and detachment (from
sense pleasures). (6.35)
One who cannot achieve control over the mind can never benefit
from meditation. One should strive to achieve mind-control through
continuous practice, focus and concentrated meditation. (6.36)
Comments: In these two verses, the Lord prescribes two ways for
one to achieve control over the mind. One would be to keep practicing
dhyana meditation and the other would be to develop detachment from
sense pleasures. Both these are not easy to achieve but one must strive to
continuously practice and over time one will be able to control one’s mind.
It is evident from one’s experience that one interested in learning any skill
in life such as sports or music, must continuously practice and never give
up. We see many examples of high achievers who have excelled in their
chosen profession by sheer grit, determination, and constant practice. The

180

The Bhagavad Gita

same qualities when applied to meditation and detachment will help one
develop control over one’s mind.
One can question as to why one would need to develop detachment
by avoiding indulgence in sensual pleasures as one can wait for such time
till all desires are exhausted. Sri Jaya Teertha in PD uses the example of a
wayward, drunk elephant which naturally becomes tame with exhaustion.
But this is not true of sense organs. It is impossible to satiate sense organs
by mere consumption. For example, one who craves good food and
consumes it in excess may temporarily feel satisfied and in fact may refuse
more food due to exhaustion. However, this feeling does not last, and the
craving comes back the next day. So, one must continuously practice
detachment to achieve control over one’s mind.

one else who can answer these questions. (6.39)
Comments: Arjuna continues his questions to Krishna on the aspect
of mind control. He realizes that many who are very sincere in their efforts
to traverse the spiritual path cannot achieve detachment even after trying.
What would happen to them, and are their efforts wasted? It appears, that
they would be denied the heavens and moksha because of their failure to
complete their prescribed duties or dhyana meditation. Or they will achieve
nothing of value in this life or after life. Will they wither away like clouds
scattered by a strong wind, or will they be relegated to hell? Arjuna, who
had previously requested Krishna to help dispel his doubts in verses 2.7 and
3.2 again begs Him for guidance.

The Lord said: O Partha! Such a sincere person will not experience
any ill effects in this world or the next. One who indulges in even limited
virtuous activities will never experience downfall. (6.40)
Comments: The Lord answers Arjuna’s questions in the next four
and half verses. Arjuna’s questions were based on the following arguments.
Some seekers may avoid performing activities that would result in rewards
such as heavens, based on their belief that those rewards are temporary.
Given the difficulty in performing concentrated meditation on the Lord,
they would also fail in dhyana meditation and would not be able to achieve
liberation. So, they would lose out on both. Lord Krishna answers in verse
6.40 stating that a seeker who has tried to perform prescribed activities,
meditation etc., will not experience any ill effects either in this world or
hereafter. They will not be denied birth in human species. And they will
indeed not be relegated to hell. Even limited but sincere efforts will save
such seekers from downfall.

and rare to get such births. (6.42)

performing their prescribed duties and have not succeeded in perfectly
completing dhyana meditation will receive additional opportunities for
fulfillment in future births. They could be reborn in advantageous
circumstances such as in pious, prosperous families or families of learned
yogis. It is rare for someone to get such opportunities. Those who are
blessed to be born in such circumstances will have the right environment
for scriptural learnings and will also be in the company of pious, learned
teachers which will surely help them in their spiritual journey.

Based on practice gained in previous births, the seeker who focuses

Such a seeker who was not able to complete a spiritual journey in a
previous birth, being born in advantageous circumstances is able to
continue the spiritual journey and perform dhyana with more precision,
finally leading to liberation. Even those seekers who are not inclined to
perform focused dhyana meditation will find themselves on that path, out

spiritual path and will eventually be rid of sins and reach His abode. It
must be noted that mere intention to perform prescribed activities and

sincere attempts at execution.

is superior. The one who performs such yoga by serving the Lord is more
superior and the one who performs such yoga with devotion, service and
without any expectations is the most superior among all such seekers.
(6.47)
Comments: The Lord concludes the teaching on dhyana yoga
meditation by describing the relative gradations among seekers who
perform such yoga. Some perform their prescribed activities and exercise
concentrated meditation on the Lord. When such meditation is combined
with devotion to the Lord (and is not done just mechanically), such efforts
are considered superior by the Lord. Seekers who go a step further and
offer their service to the Lord are even more superior. Finally, seekers who
perform prescribed duties with devotion, with their minds fully immersed
in the Lord and serve the Lord without any expectation are considered by
Lord Krishna to be the most superior among all seekers.
Given that the purpose of this chapter is to teach path of dhyana
(meditation), this last verse fully summarizes the core concepts in this
chapter. Hence, it is considered the summary verse by Sri Madinur Vishnu
Teertha in his BGS.

Chapter 6

Summary of Chapter 6
The previous chapters described the paths of action and knowledge
(karma yoga, jnana yoga). Yoga has two components – external (prescribed
activities that one performs which are visible to others) and internal. The
internal component of yoga is termed dhyana yoga (path of meditation),
This chapter delves into details of dhyana yoga or atma samyama yoga (the
Path of Self-Restraint). The Lord starts by stating that a real yogi is one
who relinquishes expectations from actions and not one who merely gives
up ritual fire sacrifices (6.1). Such a seeker also has societal obligations to
help the underprivileged (6.3). A seeker must exercise control over the
sense organs and the mind. The importance of the mind which can be both
a friend and a foe to a seeker is explained in verses 6.5–6.8. A yogi sees the
Lord equally in everyone. The process of meditation in terms of location,
physical pose etc., are described in verses 6.10–6.14. Successful meditation
also requires moderation in activities such as eating, sleeping etc. Verses
6.20-6.23 describe the nature of inner bliss experienced by a yogi during
dhyana meditation. The requirement for controlling the sense organs and
the mind for successful meditation are described in verses 6.24-6.32.
Arjuna expresses the difficulty one would face in controlling the mind in
verses 6.33-6.34, and Lord Krishna describes the solution for the fate of
those seekers who may sincerely approach the spiritual path but are not
able to execute it for various reasons. In verses 6.40-6.45, the Lord assures
that no sincere efforts are wasted, and the seeker will get additional
opportunities for self-realization in future births. In verse 6.47, the Lord
concludes the teachings in this chapter by stating that among all seekers
who practise dhyana meditation, superior are those who perform their
prescribed activities with devotion to the Lord, without expectations.

Chapter 7 - The Path of Knowledge and Wisdom
Chapter Introduction: In this chapter of 30 verses, the Lord teaches
the concepts of jnana (knowledge) and vijnana (special knowledge or
wisdom). In verse 2.39, the Lord stated that He would teach about the yoga
(way or path) to achieve divine, spiritual knowledge, knowing which one
would be able to properly perform prescribed duties, get rid of accrued sins,
and achieve liberation. Such procedures were described from chapters 2 to
6. The path described had two components, external and internal. The
external component dealt with the procedures to be performed, and this was
covered till chapter 5. Chapter 6 dealt with the internal procedure of
dhyana meditation that a seeker needs to perform. Thus, the first 6 chapters
were broadly concerned with descriptions of the methods and procedures
(both external and internal) a seeker would need to perform to be able to
acquire divine, spiritual knowledge. The next 6 chapters describe in more
detail such divine, spiritual knowledge about the Lord Almighty, which
forms the principal message of the Gita. In the earlier chapters 2 – 6, there
were some discussions on the Lord’s attributes which were included
contextually, but the next 6 chapters provide more, exclusive details about
the Lord’s attributes. The term jnana in general means ordinary knowledge,
which is acquired through the study of scriptures, learning from teachers
etc. This is also known as paroksha jnana (indirect knowledge), as one
acquires this before attaining self-realization. Vijnana is specialised
knowledge or wisdom acquired after self-realization. This is also known as
aparoksha jnana (direct knowledge). This chapter provides a detailed
discussion of these two types of knowledge. The two types of knowledge
are specifically about the Lord Almighty.

The Lord said: O Partha! With your mind fully absorbed in Me,
seeking refuge in Me, meditate on Me. Listen to Me to understand the way
(yoga) you can extensively know Me, dispelling all the doubts. (7.1)
Comments: The Lord starts His sermon to Arjuna about His
attributes. To understand these, seekers would require their minds to be
completely focused on the Lord with firm conviction that the Lord is the
protector and shelter for all. The Lord uses the adjectives asamshayam
(without doubt) and samagram (complete) in this verse. Sri Madhwacharya
in his GB clarifies that these words cannot be interpreted to conclude that
one can completely understand the Lord. Rather they refer to the
knowledge that a seeker can acquire, meaning that by listening to the
Lord’s teachings attentively, a seeker can understand the Lord’s attributes
to the maximum extent (based on the seeker’s abilities). Even deities such
as Rudra, Brahma etc., cannot completely comprehend the Lord’s attributes
which are infinite.

Comments: The Lord states the two types of knowledge that He
would be imparting. Jnana refers to ordinary or indirect knowledge
(paroksha jnana) which one normally acquires through studies of
scriptures, learning from teachers etc. Vijnana = vishesha jnana refers to

188

The Bhagavad Gita

specialized knowledge which refers to the direct knowledge (aparoksha
jnana) that one would acquire after having been blessed with a vision of the
Lord.

One in a thousand will strive to gain spiritual knowledge. Among

these even fewer will understand Me properly. (7.3)
Comments: Among the masses, only very few will have the
inclination to learn about the Lord, and among them even fewer will
succeed in gaining some knowledge. Among those who have learnt
something, very few would have properly learnt about the Lord’s attributes.
Again, it should be noted that knowing properly about the Lord’s attributes
does not equate to knowing fully about the Lord. One can learn properly
only about a fraction of the Lord’s attributes.

Earth, water, fire, wind, space, mind, intellect, and individuation are
the eight different parts of inert nature that are under My control. (7.4)
Comments: In verse 7.2, the Lord resolves to teach Arjuna ordinary
knowledge (jnana) first, and later specialized, divine knowledge (vijnana).
That teaching starts from this verse onwards. Previously, in verse 5.29 and
others, it was stated that the Lord is the Lord of everyone and everything in
the universe. The next few verses provide more details on the components

Chapter 7

189

of the universe which are all under the control of the Lord. This verse
explicitly states that inert nature which is made up of the basic elements
(earth, fire, water, wind, space) and the principles of mind, individuation,
and intellect are all under the control of the Lord. Sri Rayaru clarifies in
GV, quoting from GB that the principle of individuation (ahankara) also
includes the superior principle of cosmic intelligence (mahat).

superior to Goddess Mahalakshmi and all liberated souls who have
achieved moksha. (7.5)
Comments: In the previous verse 7.4, the Lord described the
components of inert nature and indicated that they all act under His control.
In this verse, He identifies other, sentient components of the universe such
as individual souls, liberated souls, and the ever-liberated Goddess
Mahalakshmi, and clarifies that they too are under His control.

Comments: The universe is made up of inert matter and sentient

the universe under His control, but He is also responsible for the creation
and dissolution of the universe. The Lord states ‘aham prabhavaha

190

The Bhagavad Gita

pralayaha’, which literally means, ‘I am creation and dissolution’. Sri
Rayaru in GV quoting Sri Madhwacharya’s GB clarifies that the actual
meaning of this phrase is ‘I am responsible for creation and dissolution’
stating that the phrase is used in a figurative sense. For example, it is
common for many to refer to a kingdom by the name of its king. This is
done in the context of a king who has full control over his kingdom.

O Dhananjaya! There is no entity in this universe that is superior to
Me (Lord Krishna). Everything in the universe is supported by Me, just like
a garland of pearls is supported by a string. (7.7)
Comments: This verse is one of the most quoted verses in the Gita
as it emphatically captures the Lord’s declaration that He is the Supreme
One, and everything and everyone in the universe are under His control – in
other words, the principle of Vishnu’s Supremacy (Vishnu Sarvottamatva).
When the Lord indicates that everything in the universe acts under His
control and He is responsible for the universe’s creation and dissolution, He
clarifies that there is no one superior to Him and He is also responsible for
the sustenance of the universe. Any confusion that some may have that
perhaps Maya (or illusion) covers even the Lord, is categorically dispelled
here.
It is interesting to note the simile of a bunch of pearls supported by a
string is used here to describe the Lord supporting the universe. While one
can see pearls worn by someone, the string is not visible. But if the string
were to snap, the pearls will not hold together. Similarly, while the Lord
supports the universe, one cannot see Him. He indeed works in mysterious
ways.

Author’s Note: This is also an interesting verse from the perspective
of numerology. Number 7 is considered very auspicious, and Gita has 700
verses. The fact that the Lord’s supremacy is demonstrated in the 7th verse
of the 7th chapter is worth noting.

O Son of Kunti! I am the sweetness in water. I am the radiance in the
Sun and the Moon. I am the primordial syllable Om in the Vedas. I am the
sound in space. I am virility in humans. (7.8)
Comments: In verse 7.2, the Lord resolved to teach Arjuna both
indirect (ordinary) knowledge (jnana) and direct (special, divine)
knowledge (vijnana). Some aspects of indirect knowledge were covered in
verses 7.4 – 7.7. In the next few verses, the Lord provides more specialized
details about His attributes and glories which form specialized knowledge
(vijnana). In verses 7.4 – 7.7, the Lord states that everything and everyone
in the universe act under His ownership and control. In the next few verses,
He provides more details about the meaning of ownership. The basic
elements of nature such as water, fire etc., are under His control, and in
addition, the Lord owns and powers the essence in these elements. The
Lord provides the character of sweetness to water; hence He is known as
sweetness. Likewise, He powers the radiance in the Sun and the Moon. He
is also known as Om, the primordial syllable which is the root for all Vedic
literature. The syllable Om is made up of 3 letters; a, u, and ma, and these
gave rise to the triumvirate in the holy hymn, Gayatri which in turn gave
rise to the 3 parts of the Purusha Sookta hymns from the Vedas, from
which arose Vedic literature. The Lord also empowers virility in humans.

The Bhagavad Gita

I am the fragrance on earth. I am the brilliance in fire. I am the life in
living beings. I am the austerity in ascetics. (7.9)
Comments: The Lord causes and consumes the pleasant fragrance in
earthly material. The reason for the use of the adjective pleasant is to
clarify that earthly materials emanate different smells, and the Lord
consumes only pleasant fragrance. Fire has both radiance and energy. In the
previous verse, it was stated that the Lord is responsible for the radiance in
luminous objects such as the Sun, the Moon and Fire. Here He is
confirming that even the energy in these objects are due to Him alone. The
Lord has special affection for ascetics who are constantly meditating on
Him. He states that He powers the austerity in ascetics.

Know that I am the eternal seed and the root cause for the existence
of all beings. Intelligence in the intelligent is due to Me. Strength in the
powerful is due to Me (The Lord is the root cause not only of all beings but
also of their strength and qualities). (7.10)
Comments: The Lord has stated previously that all objects in the
universe such as the five basic elements of nature, the Sun, the Moon etc.,
are all under His control. In addition, He has separately clarified in verses
7.8 onwards, that not only are all objects under His control, their innate
attributes (such as sweetness in water, radiance/energy in fire) are also due
to Him alone. A tailor designs a dress using basic materials such as cloth,
thread etc., and the finished dress has all characteristics of its ingredients
such as softness, strength etc. The tailor gets the credit for creating the
dress, but he has no role in the presence of the innate qualities of the
ingredients. The Lord is not like the tailor in this example. He not only is
responsible for the creation of objects but is also responsible for the innate
qualities in those objects. These aspects form part of vijnana, which is
specialized knowledge about the Lord’s greatness. A seeker needs to

Chapter 7

193

understand this, and only then will he be able to develop trust and faith in
worshipping the Lord. Sri Rayaru in GV also interprets this verse to
indicate that even deities who govern the intrinsic attributes of objects are
under the Lord’s control.

Comments: The Lord who is devoid of any defects or weaknesses
represents the positive attributes in individuals such as strength in powerful
people who do not use such strength for negative purposes. One should
visualize and worship the Lord, as represented by the positive aspects and
attributes of objects.

All entities defined by pious (sattv), or passionate (rajas) or ignorant
(tamas) qualities are powered and controlled by Me. I am not dependent on
them, but they all depend on Me. (7.12)
Comments: In verses 7.8 – 7.11, the Lord states that He is the
essence of all objects, and identifies them by way of examples: sweetness
in water, radiance in fire, the primordial symbol Om in the scriptures,
intelligence in the wise, strength in the powerful, etc. On the surface, these
verses seem to indicate the Lord’s identity with these attributes. While
these attributes were created by and act under the control of the Lord, they
are not identical to the Lord. This verse clarifies this relationship by clearly
stating that all objects in the universe comprised of the triumvirate of
attributes (sattv, rajas, tamas) are under His control. The Lord further states

194

The Bhagavad Gita

that He is not dependent on them and rather, they all depend on Him, thus
making it abundantly clear that these objects and attributes are not identical
to Him but in fact owe their existence to Him.

Deluded by the influence of the three qualities of nature, the world
fails to recognize Me as the supreme (param) and immutable (avyayam)
being. (7.13)
Comments: How can the world made up of the three qualities come
under delusion and not realize the Lord as being beyond the three qualities?
Sri Rayaru in GV explains that people look at other people in the world
whose physical bodies are made up of the three qualities. They conclude
that similarly, the Lord’s body could also be made up of these three
qualities. However, learned ones understand that the Lord’s body is
transcendental in nature and is not subject to birth or decay or destruction.
The Lord who has limitless auspicious attributes is beyond the three
qualities of nature. This concept is also part of vijnana (specialized
knowledge about the Lord).
While the Lord, during His incarnation in this world as Rama or
Krishna, looks and acts like any other human being, from time to time He
also demonstrates extraordinary powers (far and beyond any human’s
capacity) which are described in epics such as the Mahabharata. Hence, a
seeker will be able to understand the Lord’s superiority by hearing about
His glories.

Maya (the divine illusion), the governing deity of these three
qualities is under My control. No one can overcome this illusion. Only
those who take shelter in Me can cross this illusion. (7.14)
Comments: What causes delusion in people? This verse answers by
stating that delusion is due to the influence of the three qualities of sattv,
rajas and tamas and they are caused by Nature presided over by Goddess
Durga (as per Sri Rayaru [GV]). How can one overcome such delusion? As
Maya operates under the control of the Lord, one must surrender to the
Lord to be freed from delusion.

Ignorant, sinful individuals deprived of proper knowledge caused by

Comments: In the previous verse, the Lord states that one can
overcome delusion by taking shelter in Him. If so, why isn’t everyone
following this advice? The Lord responds by stating that individuals who
by nature are ignorant and sinful are not able to overcome delusion, which
prevents them from acquiring proper knowledge of Him. They have a
demoniac nature and hence do not surrender to Him and are not able to
overcome delusion.

seeking spiritual knowledge, those seeking riches and the learned ones
(who have already acquired spiritual knowledge). (7.16)
Comments: The previous verse describes sinful people who do not
surrender to the Lord. This verse describes the categories of people who are
devoted to the Lord. These largely consist of those who have some physical
ailment, those who are seeking material wealth, those who are desirous of
spiritual knowledge and those who have acquired divine, spiritual
knowledge. The Lord’s devotees who pray to the Lord in times of distress
do so as they would like to continue performing their prescribed duty as an
offering to Him and this would require them to be freed from distress.
Devotees who pray for wealth do so to help them acquire the means to
perform activities pleasing to the Lord, such as charity. Learned ones pray
for self-realization.

Comments: Among these four types of devotees, is there a
gradation? The Lord states that among these types, learned ones who have
acquired divine, spiritual knowledge are the most superior. They have two
main characteristics – (a) their minds are exclusively focused on the Lord,
and (b) they are exclusively devoted to the Lord. The Lord declares that
such devotees are fond of Him, and He is fond of them.

All these four types of people are certainly worthy. But learned ones
are like My own form. They surrender to Me completely and constantly
meditate on Me and eventually reach the highest state of bliss. (7.18)
Comments: If learned ones are superior among the four and the
Lord is fond of them, how about the other types? The Lord states that all
four types are superior devotees, but among them learned ones are the most
superior.
This verse uses the phrase ‘atma eva’ when describing learned ones.
Some philosophers interpret ‘atma eva’ to mean ‘My own form’ quoting
the text ‘nama roopevihaya’ from the Atharva Upanishat (6.8) in
reference to rivers merging in an ocean and apparently losing their identity.
Sri Vidyasagara Madhava Teertha quotes Sri Madhwacharya’s
interpretation of this Upanishat and points out that the proper word
derivation of the above text is ‘nama roopeSavihaya’ = nama roope
avihaya, which indicates that rivers maintain their identity even when they
merge with the ocean. The proper interpretation of the phrase ‘atma eva’ is
that learned ones are extremely dear to the Lord.

the true knowledge that Lord Vasudeva (Krishna), the Supreme One, is
complete in all respects and is the true owner of the universe. They
ultimately reach My abode. It is extremely rare to find such a person in this
world. (7.19)
Comments: Why will everyone not reach moksha? This verse
answers by stating that only those who attain true understanding of the
Lord Almighty will reach His abode. Not everyone is convinced of the
Lord’s attributes. Learned ones, over many births perform their prescribed
duties without expectations of rewards, with devotion to the Lord. Through

198

studies, learning etc., they attain true knowledge about the Lord’s attributes
such as the Lord’s ownership of the universe and His completeness. They
eventually reach His abode. Such learned people are rare.

Comments: In the previous verse, it was stated that learned people
with true, divine knowledge are rare in this world. However, one does see
many religious people in the world. So, how can the learned be considered
rare? This verse answers by stating that not everyone worships the Lord
without expectations on rewards. Many people in the world, who are drawn
to material riches perform religious rituals as stipulated in the scriptures to
propitiate and please lesser deities. They do this based on their innate
nature and are unable to attain proper, divine knowledge.

Such a devotee will propitiate the chosen deity with unflinching faith
and will receive the fruits of the worship which are granted by Me

Chapter 7

199

Comments: There are broadly two types of devotees which are not
mutually exclusive. Shuddha Bhagavathas (Pure Devotees of Lord
Almighty) and Mishrayajees (devotees of other deities). Verse 7.19
describes the characteristics of learned ones and they belong to the class of
Shuddha Bhagavathas. Among Mishrayajees (Mishra = mixed; yajee =
worshipper), there are two types. The first category is the so called
Trividyas (those who perform rituals based on the peripheral meanings of
the three Vedas). They believe that the purpose of the Vedas is to help one
acquire material riches and they accordingly perform Vedic rituals to
propitiate lesser deities to get their desires fulfilled. Even in this case, the
actual rewards are granted by the Lord using lesser deities as the medium.
The second category of Mishrayajees are really Shuddha Bhagavathas who
are pure devotees of the Lord, but for various reasons also propitiate other
deities. They will over the time receive proper guidance from a teacher and
will focus on worship of the Lord without expectation and will ultimately
achieve moksha.

Those who propitiate other deities due to their limited understanding,
will receive only minimum, temporary fruits. On the other hand, those who
are primarily devoted to Me will ultimately reach Me and experience
eternal bliss. (7.23)
Comments: If propitiating other deities results in rewards, why
should one focus on propitiating the Lord Almighty alone? This verse
answers by stating that one who propitiates only other, lesser deities will
receive only temporary fruits. Even if they reach the worlds of other deities
after their time on earth, their stay in those worlds will be temporary. On
the other hand, devotees who primarily worship the Lord Almighty will
eventually attain the Lord’s abode permanently. Sri Rayaru clarifies in GV
that it is not prohibited for one to worship other deities; one should worship

200

The Bhagavad Gita

other deities as members of the Lord Almighty’s entourage (parivara) and
not separately.

Unwise people, who are not aware of My eternal, infinite,

having a perishable existence. (7.24)
Comments: What separates the Lord Almighty from other deities?
Why do those who propitiate other deities receive temporary rewards,
while those who worship the Lord Almighty receive permanent bliss? This
verse answers these questions. Ignorant ones (termed abuddhayas) do not
realize that the Lord Almighty is supreme, has no births, and does not have
a perishable body. They perceive the Lord as having perishable existence.
Sri Rayaru in GV provides a second interpretation for this verse as
follows – Ignorant ones who are not able to comprehend the Lord’s
supremacy or His infinite, auspicious attributes, regard Him as identical to
individual souls.
In summary, verses 7.20 to 7.24 describe the characteristics of the
three types of beings: Shuddha Bhagavathas (sattvic), Trividyas (rajasic),
and Abuddhayas (tamasic). This concept is covered in detail in Chapter 17.

Chapter 7

201

Comments: Why are some not able to acquire proper understanding
of the Lord’s attributes? This verse states that one can only imbibe
knowledge based on one’s innate nature. It is due to the will of the Lord
Almighty and Goddess Durga’s form of MahaLakshmi (who operates
under the control of Lord as per verse 7.14) that the ignorant are not able to
acquire proper understanding of the Lord’s attributes. Does it cause
concern to the Lord that some ascribe wrong qualities on Him? No. It is the
Lord Himself who causes such ignorance to the undeserving.
The word yogamaya is interpreted as ‘yoga sahita maya’, where
yoga refers to the Lord’s infinite strength and maya refers to Goddess
Durga. As per Sri Madhwacharya [GB], Sri Jaya Teertha [PD], and Sri
Rayaru [GV], yoga can be interpreted to mean either upaya (means or
instrument) or strength (shakti). However, in this verse, the interpretation
of yoga as strength is correct as maya already represents the instrument
(upaya) of strength. This interpretation is also supported by Padma
Purana.

Comments: If the curtain of Maya results in some not being able to
understand the Lord’s attributes, does the same curtain prevent the Lord
from knowing about them? This verse emphatically states that the Lord
knows everything (past, present and even future) about everyone. This in
fact is one of His major attributes. However, no one knows the Lord
completely. Other enormously powerful deities such as Goddess
Mahalakshmi, Brahma, Vayudeva etc., know the Lord Almighty extremely
well, but not fully, and their knowledge is also due to His grace.

O Bharata! O Parantapa! All beings are ignorant about the Lord from
the very beginning of creation due their delusion in dualities such as
happiness/sadness, caused due to corruption by the qualities of
desire/hatred. (7.27)
Comments: In verses 7.14 and 7.25, it was stated that the prime
cause for one’s ignorance is the will of the Lord Almighty and Goddess
Durga. This verse states that, in addition, there are two secondary causes
for one’s ignorance: desire and aversion. These two passions cloud one’s
judgement about dualities such as happiness/sadness, success/failure etc.
An alternate interpretation by Sri Rayaru in GV based on Sri
Madhwacharya’s GB and GTN is as follows: the primary reason for one’s
delusion in non-duality of the Lord and the individual soul is due to the
influence of the Lord and Goddess Durga.

Comments: This verse concludes the teaching in this chapter, which
is about the concepts of knowledge and wisdom. The Lord summarizes the
teaching by stating that the learned ones who are focused on Him with
steadfast conviction are knowledgeable about specialized topics (vijnana)

204

The Bhagavad Gita

such as Brahma, Karma, Adhyatma, Adhibhoota, Adhidaiva and Adhiyajna.
Remembering this knowledge especially during the time a seeker leaves the
body will ensure that the seeker will attain the Lord. These concepts are
described in more detail in the next chapter.
Summary of Chapter 7
The first 6 chapters were broadly concerned with descriptions of the
methods and procedures (both external and internal) that a seeker would
need to perform to be able to acquire divine, spiritual knowledge. The next
6 chapters describe in more detail such divine, spiritual knowledge about
the Lord, which forms the principal message of the Gita. In earlier chapters
2 – 6, there were some discussions on the Lord’s attributes which were
included contextually, and the next 6 chapters provide more exclusive
details about the Lord’ attributes. Chapter 7 provides a detailed discussion
of the two types of learning – knowledge and wisdom. Ordinary knowledge
(jnana) is that knowledge that is gained from scriptural studies and through
teachers. Wisdom or direct knowledge (vijnana) is specialized knowledge
about the Lord Almighty that one can attain after self-realization. In verses
7.4 - 7.6, the components of the eight-fold nature in the universe are
identified. In verses 7.7 - 7.11, the Lord describes His ownership of
everything in the universe and stresses that He is responsible for even the
intrinsic attributes of objects. The cause of ignorance, the influence of
delusion on living beings, and procedure to overcome delusion are also
discussed in verses 7.13 – 7.14. The various types of seekers who are
devoted to the Lord are identified in verses 7.16 – 7.19 as those in sickness,
those seeking spiritual knowledge, those seeking riches, and those who
have already acquired divine, spiritual knowledge. Among these four types
of devotees, the Lord is fond of the last type who worship Him without any
expectations. Verses 7.20 – 7.23 deal with worshippers of other deities in
comparison with those who are exclusively devoted to the Lord Almighty.
Those who only worship other deities may receive temporary fruits and

Chapter 7

205

those who exclusively worship the Lord Almighty ultimately attain
everlasting bliss. In verses 7.24 - 7.26, the issue of false knowledge is
described. In verse 7.28, the Lord exhorts the virtuous to overcome false
knowledge and worship Him with conviction. The chapter ends with a
message from the Lord in verses 7.29 – 7.30 about the thoughts that a
seeker should focus on at the time of leaving this world. These last two
verses act as a bridge to the next chapter where the concepts introduced
here are dealt with in detail.

Chapter Introduction: This chapter, titled Akshara Brahma Yoga,
the path of the imperishable Lord, comprising 28 verses, shows the sure
path to reach the Lord through concentrated meditation and single pointed
devotion. The previous chapter covered the issues of indirect knowledge
and direct knowledge as they relate to the Lord. Towards the end of the
chapter, in verses 7.29 and 7.30, the Lord introduced some special topics
such as Adhibhoota, Adhidaiva, Adhiyajna, etc. This terminology was used
for the first time, and Arjuna naturally has questions about its context and
meaning. The Lord answers Arjuna’s questions, and much of the chapter is
devoted to the act of remembering the Lord during one’s final moments and
one’s journey hereafter.

this body? And why? How are you to be known at the time of departure by
yogis (seekers) with self-control? (8.2)

Comments: In verse 7.30, the Lord stated the need for one to have
proper knowledge about Him, especially during one’s last moments. Arjuna
has eight questions regarding the concepts in verses 7.29 and 7.30. Lord
Krishna answers these questions in the next few verses.
Brahma, Karma, Adhibhoota, Adhidaiva, Adhyatma, Adhiyajna

The Lord said: Brahma refers to the imperishable Lord who pervades
everything and everyone. Adhyatma refers to the material equipment that
allows a soul to act (body, sense organs, conscience). Karma refers to the
Lord’s act of creation, which is responsible for the birth and existence of all
living beings. 8.3
Comments: The Lord responds to each of Arjuna’s eight questions.
 Brahma refers to the imperishable Lord Almighty. The adjective
param (meaning supreme) is used here to denote the Lord Almighty,
as there are other imperishable (akshara) entities also in the universe
such as inert nature, the letters, the Vedas, etc. (verse 2.17) which
are dependent on the Lord
 Adhyatma (prime self) refers to material equipment that helps a soul
function in this world: the physical body, sense organs, and
conscience (which the Lord grants according to a soul’s svabhāva or
innate nature).
 Karma (Fruitive Action) refers to visarga, the special activity of
creating the universe performed by the Lord Almighty.

The Bhagavad Gita

O Arjuna! The five basic elements of material nature (earth, fire,
water, space, and wind) form Adhibhoota. Superior deities who reside
inside and govern the physical bodies of living beings (namely Sesha, the
serpent deity, and the four faced deity Brahma) form Adhidaiva. Powering
all living beings and the consumer of offerings in all sacrifices is I, going
by the name of Adhiyajna (Lord of Sacrifice). (8.4)
Comments: The Lord continues to answer Arjuna’s remaining questions:
 Adhibhoota (Prime Nature) refers to the five basic elements of
nature, (fire, water, earth, space, and wind) that comprise one’s
physical body.
 Adhidaiva (prime deities) refers to superior deities such as Sesha and
four-faced Brahma that reside in the bodies of living beings.
 Adhiyajna (Lord of Sacrifice) refers to Me (Lord Krishna).
 The Lord is termed Adhiyajna as He activates and powers one to
perform sacrifices, and He is also the consumer of the essence of
such sacrifices, as was stated previously (verse 5.29).
Sri Rayaru in GV provides additional interpretations for some of these
entities based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GB as follows: Adhyatma also refers
to the Lord’s form (as He has the prime or supreme form), Adhidaiva also
refers to Goddess Mahalakshmi (as she is the foremost among all deities),
and Adhibhoota refers to all living beings (as living beings are superior to
inert objects).

One who thinks of Me (Krishna) at the time of leaving one’s body
will attain Me. There is no doubt about this. (8.5)
O son of Kunti! Whatever entity one thinks of at the time of leaving
one’s body, one will attain the same entity (due to the force of habit). (8.6)
Comments: The Lord answers Arjuna’s eighth question by stating
that learned seekers remember the Lord at the time of leaving the body
which results in their attaining the Lord, which is a state of permanent,
exalted happiness devoid of any misery. How does one who is focused on
the Lord at the time of departing this world reach the Lord? Whatever
entity one is thinking of during the last moments, the person will attain that
entity in the succeeding births. The story of King Bharata in the Bhagavata
Purana illustrates this. Bharata once rescued a deer struggling in flood
waters and nursed it back to health. He developed a strong attachment to it
and was thinking of it even at the last moments of his life. This resulted in
him being born as a deer.
It should be noted that the verse says, anta kala, meaning the final
moments. It does not say the final instant. This is because everyone, at the
exact final instant of the soul leaving the body, feels relief. However, it is
only the learned devotees of the Lord who remember Him in the moments
leading up to death.
Sri Madhwacharya in his Bhagavata Tatparya Nirnaya [BTN]
commentary on the epic Bhagavata Maha Purana [BMP] (10.1.42)
quotes the Naradeeya Purana and states that one’s innate eligibility and
the Lord’s will are the deciding factors in determining one’s next birth (in
addition to ones final thoughts). Thus, one who is thinking of angels during
the last moments may not be born as an angel but may be born in the
vicinity of angels.

Hence keep thinking about Me (Krishna) always. Perform your duty
of fighting this just war with your mind and intellect focused on Me and
you will certainly attain Me. There is no doubt about this. (8.7)
Comments: After emphasizing the need to remember Him during
one’s last moments, the Lord gets back to Arjuna’s dilemma. He exhorts
him to keep his mind and intellect focused on Him and get on with fighting
the just war. This would ensure that Arjuna would not be tainted by any
adverse effects of the war.

Comments: How can one ensure that one’s mind will be focused on
the Lord during the final moments, especially as one would normally be in
great pain due to physical ailments? The Lord answers by stating that
through rigorous practice of mind control, one can develop the habit of
focusing the mind on Him and approach all activities with the attitude that
He is the one who is performing the activities. This will help a seeker keep
the Lord in mind, which becomes useful during the last moments of life.

One should meditate on the Lord Almighty as one who is
omniscient, who is ancient, who governs the entire universe, who is smaller
than the smallest object, who supports and protects everyone and
everything in the universe, who is incomprehensible, who has the radiance
of the sun, and who transcends material nature. One should think of the
Lord, especially during one’s last moments. (8.9)
Comments: The previous verses stated that one must remember the
Lord during one’s final moments. In what way should one remember the
Lord? This verse provides a compact yet powerful description of the Lord’s
form and attributes as eight qualities that one must memorise and make
efforts to remember always. This would make it easy for a seeker to
remember the Lord during the final moments. The comparison of the
Lord’s radiance with that of the sun is only to give an example so that one
can comprehend it to some extent. The Lord’s qualities, such as radiance
and splendor, are infinite. Just to ensure that there is no misinterpretation
due to the comparison with the sun, this verse also uses the phrase tamasa
para meaning the Lord transcends material nature.

Comments: This verse describes the breath control that one must
attempt at the last moments of life while one is meditating on the Lord. Sri
Rayaru in GV clarifies that this requirement applies primarily to those who
are practitioners of pranayama and have attained proficiency in breath
control and are termed vayujayis (ones who have conquered breath). One

212

The Bhagavad Gita

must practise other techniques indicated earlier, such as detachment,
devotion, learning etc., to achieve moksha. Sri Jaya Teertha in PD states
that two types of seekers are recognised here. One who is proficient in the
path of devotion (Bhakti Yoga), and the other who is proficient in breath
control (pranayama).

Principal (Lord Almighty). (8.11)

control for those proficient in pranayama (which should also be attempted
by everyone else). This verse describes further requirements for those who
have conquered the breath (vayujayi).

At the time of leaving the physical body, a seeker should control all
channel outlets in the body (except the Sushumna channel), with the mind
focused on the Lord, and immerse in continuous meditation on the Lord,
with the life breath centred on the forehead. (8.12)

Chapter 8

213

Such a person who, with great devotion to the Lord, chants the
primordial syllable Om will leave the body to traverse to the Lord’s abode.
(8.13)
Comments: As there are many channels in the body, one must
attempt to leave the body out of the head through the Sushumna channel to
reach the Lord’s abode. One who leaves the body through other channels
will reach other worlds. For example, one leaving out of one’s eye will
reach Surya Loka, the world of the Sun deity. This verse also states that the
seeker should focus the mind on hrudi, which Sri Rayaru GV clarifies in a
reference to Lord Narayana. The word hrudi expands as harati + jagat,
meaning ‘One who dissolves the universe’.
The primordial syllable Om succinctly represents the Lord. Om made
up of three letters a, u, and ma, expands into the three parts of the holy
Gayatri hymn, which itself expands into the three sections of the Vedic
hymn, the Purusha Sookta, from which all Vedic literature emerged. Later
in chapter 10.25, the Lord Himself states that among all letters, He dwells
in the letter Om giving it supremacy. Verse 17.23 also has additional details
on the primordial syllable Om.

O Partha! I am easily attainable to those who are continuously

Comments: In the previous verses, the Lord instructed that one
should strive to remember Him during one’s final moments. In this verse, it
is clarified that only those who are constantly thinking about, meditating on
the Lord (nitya yukta) and forcibly withdrawing the wandering mind from
worldly issues, will be able to remember Him when it counts the most, that
is, at the final moment.

deaths. O son of Kunti! Those who attain My abode will be in eternal bliss
and will never be born again. (8.16)
Comments: In verse 8.13, it is stated that the learned ones who
remember the Lord during their final moments will reach the Lord’s abode.
These two verses clarify that one who reaches the Lord’s abode will not
return to the earth, which is the dwelling place for living beings with
transitory physical bodies.
The six upper worlds above earth are Bhuvarloka, Suvarloka,
Maharloka, Janoloka, Tapoloka and Satyaloka. Those who reach the
worlds of Janoloka, Tapoloka, and Satyaloka will not return to earth. This
is because of the Lord’s special presence in them. This is clarified by Sri
Rayaru in [GV].

Those who know that the Lord’s day spans over multitudes of yugas

Night. (8.17)
Comments: In this verse, the Lord introduces the concept of day and
night in relation to His acts of creation and dissolution of the universe. Sri
Rayaru in GV states that the word sahasra used in this verse should not be
construed to literally mean thousands, but to uncountable multitudes (as no
one can count the Lord’s time). The duration of creation and dissolution of
the universe are symbolically indicated as daytime and night-time for the
Lord Almighty, as His time cannot be measured.
Sri Satyadhyana Teertha in his GPC states that the yuga referred here
indicates one hundred years of deity Brahma, whose one year is made up of
360 days, with each day equating to 864 crore (8.64 billion) human years.

Comments: The dawn of the day for the Lord (avyakta) is when the
dissolution of the universe is complete and the process of creation starts.
The time of dissolution of the universe is described as the “nighttime of the
Lord”. No one can measure the Lord’s time. Sri Madhwacharya in GTN
states that the word nimesha (time to bat an eyelid) is used to informally

The unmanifest entity, which is vastly different and superior to the

invisible supreme Lord Almighty, who will never perish even when
everything in the universe perishes. (8.20)
This unmanifest principle is the Lord Almighty, to reach whom, is
the goal of everyone. One who reaches Him will never return to this world.
Such is My supreme form. (8.21)
Comments: Since the previous verses described the concepts of day
and night for the Lord to represent the times of creation and dissolution of
the universe, one may question if the Lord is also subject to birth and

Chapter 8

217

decay. Verse 8.20 clarifies that the Lord, who is responsible for creation
and dissolution, is eternal, has no beginning or end, and is imperishable.
Verse 8.21 clarifies that He goes by the name of Akshara (one without
decay), because of His imperishable nature. This verse also states that one
who reaches the Lord’s abode will never return to the earth.
Verse 8.20 uses the terms para and anya meaning supreme and
different, respectively, indicating that the Lord Almighty is superior to and
different from all other entities in the universe, such as individual souls and
inert objects. This concept is further emphasised later in Chapter 15 (verses
16-20) and validates the philosophy of dualism propagated by Sri
Madhwacharya.

O Arjuna, superior among the Bharatas! I will now teach you about
the paths taken by seekers, from which they will either return to this world
or not return to this world. The paths are identified by their respective
governing deities. (8.23)
Eligible seekers, leaving this world through the paths of deities
governing fire, light, daytime, the fortnight of the waxing moon, and the
first half of a lunar year, will reach the abode of the Lord and not return to
this world. (8.24)
Other seekers leaving this world through the path of deities
governing smoke, nighttime, the fortnight of the waning moon, and the
second half of a lunar year will reach the land of the Moon deity and will
return to this world again. (8.25)
These two paths are permanent and are termed the Shukla path and
the Krishna path. Those leaving through the first path will not return, and
those leaving through the second path will return to this world. (8.26)
Comments: These three verses describe the paths taken by a soul
after leaving the physical body. The soul progressively traverses the worlds
governed by various deities. Some seekers leave this world and traverse the
worlds governed by the following deities: Agni/Archi (fire), Aha (daytime),
Shukla Paksha (fortnight of waxing moon), and uttarayana (first half of a
lunar new year). These seekers, who predominantly take the path of
knowledge (jnana yogis), will ultimately reach the abode of the Lord
Almighty and never return to the earth. Other seekers leave this world and
traverse the worlds governed by the following deities: dhooma (smoke),

Chapter 8

219

ratri (nighttime), krishna paksha (fortnight of the waning moon) and
dakshinayana (second half of a lunar new year). These seekers, who are
focused on the path of action (karma yogis) with the expectation of rewards
will return to this earth.
Some commentators adopt the literal translation of the times and
periods indicated in these verses and wrongly conclude that the destination
of a soul depends on the time, day, fortnight, and month of leaving this
world. Sri Rayaru in GV, based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GB, clarifies that
the reference to the time periods indicated in these verses should be
interpreted to mean the respective governing deities. After all, time is inert.
How can time determine the destination of a soul? Also, not all entities
identified in these verses are related to time (kala). For example,
agni/archi, and dhooma are not related to time. Hence, the entities
described in these verses can only be interpreted to mean their respective
governing deities. Further, as per Sri Madhwacharya’s GB, in the Padma
Purana it is clarified that an aparoksha jnani (a seeker with direct, divine
knowledge of the Lord) will achieve liberation regardless of the time, day,
fortnight, month of leaving this world.
In the Mahabharata, it is stated that Bheeshma waited until the
onset of uttarayana (the first half of the lunar year) to leave this world.
Does this not imply the superiority of one period over the other? It is
clarified by Sri Jaya Teertha in [ND] that among those who attain
liberation, the ones who leave their body during the period of uttarayana
experience higher bliss. One must remember that Bheeshma was an iccha
marani and had the power to decide the time of his exit from the world. His
situation cannot be generalized.
In summary, a soul’s destination after leaving the physical body is
based on its efforts and performance during its soul’s lifetime in this world
and the acquisition of divine, spiritual knowledge, including knowledge
about the paths taken hereafter. The destination is not determined by the

220

The Bhagavad Gita

time of the soul leaving the body. Sri Rayaru also clarifies this in GV,
quoting the Brahma Sutra (4.2.22).

O Partha! A seeker who properly understands these two paths and
acts accordingly will never be deluded. O Arjuna, hence, always practise
the prescribed activities to reach the Lord. (8.27)
One who understands these principles will accrue more benefits
compared to accruals from studying the Vedas, performing sacrifices, and
donating to others. Moreover, such a seeker will indeed reach the Lord’s
abode. (8.28)
Comments: These two verses conclude the teachings in this chapter.
Lord Krishna instructs Arjuna to understand thoroughly the process of a
soul leaving the physical body and the paths taken in reaching the ultimate
destination. The Lord reiterates that Arjuna must perform his prescribed
duty of waging the just war with proper conviction in the concepts
described in this chapter. Further, such knowledge about the paths taken by
a soul results in one earning much more benefit than that available from
other spiritual activities such as learning the Vedas, donating to charity,
etc. The intent here is to demonstrate the importance of such knowledge.
Summary of Chapter 8
Chapter 7 covered the issues of knowledge and wisdom as they relate
to the Lord. Towards the end of that chapter, in verses 7.29 and 7.30, the

Chapter 8

221

Lord introduced some special topics such as Adhibhoota, Adhidaiva,
Adhiyajna, etc. This terminology was used for the first time, and Arjuna
naturally had questions about their context and meaning. The Lord answers
Arjuna’s questions, and much of the chapter is devoted to the act of
remembering the Lord during one’s final moments and one’s journey
hereafter. Arjuna asks eight questions in verses 8.1 and 8.2 and the Lord
answers them in verses 8.3 - 8.5. Brahma refers to the imperishable Lord.
Adhyatma refers to material equipment that allows a soul to act (body,
sense organs, conscience). Karma refers to the Lord’s act of creation,
which is responsible for the birth and existence of all living beings. Basic
elements of material nature such as earth and fire form ‘Adhibhoota’.
Superior deities who reside inside and govern the physical bodies of living
beings (namely Sesha, the serpent deity, and the four-faced deity Brahma)
form Adhidaiva. Powering all living beings and the consumer of offerings
in all sacrifices is the Lord, going by the name of Adhiyajna (Lord of
Sacrifice). The Lord answers Arjuna’s eighth question by stating that
learned seekers remember the Lord at the time of leaving their bodies,
which results in their attaining Him. In verses 8.6 - 8.14, the Lord teaches
the need for one to remember Him during the final moments and the
procedure to do the same. Verses 8.15 - 8.16 state that those who remember
the Lord properly during their final moments will not return to earth. The
concept of the Lord Almighty’s day and night and their relationship to His
acts of creation and dissolution of the universe are addressed in verses
8.17-8.20. The Lord declares in verse 8.22 that the path of devotion is
supreme among all paths available to reach the Lord. The paths taken by a
soul after leaving the physical body are described in verses 8.23 - 8.26. The
chapter is concluded in verses 8.27 and 8.28 with the Lord instructing
Arjuna to focus on his prescribed duty of waging the just war while being
fully aware of the key concepts covered in this chapter. These include the
knowledge of paths traversed by a soul after leaving the physical body,
with the ultimate destination being the Lord’s abode.

Chapter 9 – Path of Supreme Knowledge and Secrets
Chapter Introduction: This chapter, titled the ‘Path of Supreme
Knowledge and Secrets’ comprises 34 verses. The central message here is
an assurance to all seekers that they will have their desires fulfilled through
devoted worship and meditation on the Lord. The wise seek the Lord
through such devotion and worship, while the ignorant seek limited
material and mundane gains, and never lead a fulfilled life. This chapter is
a continuation of the concepts in Chapter 7 where some important attributes
of the Lord were revealed. Towards the end of Chapter 7, the Lord
introduces some new concepts such as Adhyatma, Adhibhoota, Adhidaiva,
Adhiyajna etc. Arjuna’s questions about these concepts were answered in
Chapter 8. Now, the Lord continues the discussion from Chapter 7. In that
sense, Chapters 7, 8 and 9 are in proper sequence. While the Lord has
infinite auspicious forms, attributes, activities etc., there are eight activities
of the Lord Almighty that directly impact living beings. They are – creation
(Srishti), sustenance (Stithi), dissolution (laya), regulation (niyamana),
knowledge (jnana), ignorance (ajnana), bondage (bandha) and liberation
(moksha). Together they are called Janmadi ashtaka and they are also
covered in this chapter. This chapter is called the Path of Supreme
Knowledge (‘Raja Vidya Yoga’) as it teaches these particularly important
concepts about the Lord. It is also called the Path of supreme secrets (‘Raja
Guhya Yoga’) meant only for the faithful.

The Lord said: I will now impart most confidential principles to you,
as you are devoid of faults such as envy and are eligible to receive this
teaching. Gaining this sacred and special knowledge along with knowledge
from the scriptures will free you from evil. (9.1)
It is the crown of knowledge. It is the pinnacle of secrets. It is
purifying. It is superior. It is the means to learn about the Lord Almighty
who powers everyone’s sense organs. It is easy to follow, and it is the path
for eternal bliss. (9.2)
O Parantapa! Those who do not have faith in the knowledge that
teaches about the Lord Almighty will not reach the Lord and will keep
returning to this mortal worldly life. (9.3)
Comments: The Lord starts His sermon by stating that He will be
teaching particularly, important and very confidential concepts here. This is
to draw the attention of seekers and to generate curiosity in them. Only
those who are pure and are devoid of negative attributes such as envy are
eligible and able to understand these teachings. The Lord resolves to teach
Arjuna both general knowledge that would be available from scriptures
(jnana) and special, divine knowledge (vijnana) which is not easily
available. Only those who are sincere in their devotion to the Lord can
imbibe such special knowledge, hence it is most secretive.
The Lord imparts this knowledge over the next 16 verses. In 12
verses from 9.4 – 9.15, general knowledge (jnana) that would be available
from scriptures is taught. The next 4 verses 9.16 – 9.19, contain discussion
on special, divine knowledge (vijnana).

Everything in this universe is pervaded by My unmanifest form
which cannot be seen. All inert objects and sentient beings are supported by
Me. But I am not dependent on anyone for support. (9.4)
Everything in the universe, including sentient beings and inert
objects, even though anchored in Me (Krishna), cannot perceive Me
through sense organs. Look at My infinite, divine powers. Even though
they are anchored in Me, I do not depend on them. (9.5)
The majestic wind blowing in space is not impacted by the attributes
of entities that it encounters. Similarly, even though every living being is
anchored in Me, there is no mutual superimposition of attributes. (9.6)
Comments: These three verses provide details on the concept of the
Lord’s manifestation in every object in the universe; inert and sentient. The
Lord is omnipresent and is the supporter for everything in the universe but
Himself needs no support of anyone or anything. If the Lord is pervading
everywhere, why is He not seen? Verse 9.4 defines the Lord’s attribute of
avyakta (the unmanifest), because of which He is not seen.
Anyone standing on the ground experiences the condition of the
ground. For example, if the ground is cool or hot due to the weather, one

Chapter 9

225

standing on it will feel the cold or the heat. This is due to the impact of
contact between the object that is supported and the object that is providing
the support. So, if the Lord is supporting everything in the universe, why is
that support not felt physically by the beings in the universe? This is
answered in verse 9.5, where it is stated that those who are supported by the
Lord cannot perceive Him through their sense organs. This is
fundamentally because (unlike the example of the ground), the Lord does
not have a physical form made up of material nature but has a
transcendental form.
It must be noted in verse 9.5, the Lord uses the term ‘mama atma’
(my soul) as the entity that pervades and supports everything in the
universe. However, in verse 9.4, the Lord uses the term ‘avyakta moorthy’
(unmanifest form) as the entity that pervades and supports everything in the
universe. How can these be reconciled? Sri Jaya Teertha in PD explains
that the reason for using different terminology is to confirm that, in the case
of the Lord, His form and soul are the same. This is quite different from the
case of living beings where the physical form and the soul are different.
The concept in verse 9.5 is illustrated through the example of a
gentle breeze in verse 9.6. A gentle, majestic wind blowing in space
encounters many objects in its path but does not assume the attributes of
those objects. Likewise, even though the Lord pervades everything in the
universe and supports everyone in the universe, His attributes do not get
contaminated by entities He encounters. They too cannot imbibe His
attributes onto themselves. Some can question the appropriateness of using
the wind as an example. When a gently blowing wind is in the vicinity of a
fragrant object (say a flower), one who is nearby can smell the fragrance of
the flower carried by the wind. How can one say that the wind is not
contaminated by the fragrance? Sri Rayaru in GV answers by stating that
fragrance does not itself become a quality of the wind. The wind stays
independent of the fragrance. The particles that constitute fragrance are
carried by the wind but do not become an attribute of the wind. Once the
wind travels a sufficient distance, the fragrance is no longer present as

226

The Bhagavad Gita

those particles are dissipated. This proves that the wind itself does not take
on the attribute of the fragrance. Hence, the example of the wind is
appropriate.
These verses describe the attribute of Stithi (sustenance) among the
eight major attributes of the Lord referred to in the introduction to this
chapter.

O Son of Kunti! During the grand dissolution of the universe, all

(sattva, rajas and tamas attributes) which are under My control. At the start
of the next cycle, I will recreate the entities (give them physical forms).
(9.7)
Comments: After discussing His attributes of omnipresence and
pervasiveness in verses 9.4 – 9.6, the Lord describes His role in the process
of creation (Srishti) and dissolution (laya) of the universe in the next few
verses .
The Lord uses the term ‘visrujami’ to describe His act of creation of
the universe, instead of the usual term ‘srujami’. Sri Rayaru clarifies in GV
that ‘visrujami’ refers to special creation while srujami refers to normal
creation. This is to indicate the fact that the souls of living beings are
eternal and are not subject to creation, and during the time of creation, the
Lord gives physical bodies to different souls in different species, based on
the nature of those souls.

The triumvirate of nature is always under My control. Using them as
the material cause, I keep creating multitudes of entities (sentient and inert)
again and again. (9.8)
Comments: The previous verse stated the Lord’s activities of
creation and dissolution of the universe. In this verse, the Lord states the
procedure that He uses for creation. The Lord utilizes the inert nature
which is under His control as the material cause for creation. Sri Rayaru in
GV clarifies that the Lord does not need any entity or utility to perform
activities, but He uses inert nature for creation out of His free will.

O Dhananjaya! These activities such as creation of the universe can
never bind Me. Even though I perform these activities, it is as if I never
performed them because of My detachment. (9.9)
Comments: Anyone performing any activity naturally must face
consequences for such activity. Is the Lord also bound by His activities
such as creation which results in multitudes of entities being born? This
verse answers by stating that the Lord is not bound by His actions. There
are two reasons for this. One, the Lord does not perform these actions for
any gain but rather to help the individual souls on their spiritual journey.
Secondly, the Lord Himself controls all activities (karma). Therefore,
karma can never bind the Lord.
Sri Madhwacharya in GB explains the context for the use of the
word udaaseena (meaning indifference) when it comes to the Lord’s
attitude in performing actions such as creation. It is known that one needs
the Lord’s grace to receive any benefits from Him. Given this, the Lord
must have some interest in such activities. How can He then be indifferent?
We can understand this when we see that the word ‘indifferent’ refers to

228

The Bhagavad Gita

the Lord’s effortless, unattached approach to His activities as He has
nothing to gain from them.

O Son of Kunti! Under My supervision, Mother Nature creates the
universe made up of sentient and inert objects. Through the mother nature,
the universe undergoes the cycle of repeated creation. (9.10)
Comments: If the Lord indeed shows indifference in the process of
creation of the Universe, as stated in the previous verse, does it mean that
the Lord has no interest in or oversight over this activity? This verse
counters this question by stating that the process of creation and indeed all
His activities occur under His supervision, which is implied by the use of
the word adhyaksha. Sri Rayaru explains in GV that adhyaksha means one
who is overseeing or supervising the activity, as aksha means seeing. The
process of creation is performed by sentient Mother Nature (Sri Lakshmi)
using inert nature, under the supervision and control of the Lord. In
summary, while the Lord performs creation using sentient and insentient
nature without effort or attachment, He supervises and oversees the
process. This verse describes the attribute of Niyamana (regulation) among
the eight major attributes of the Lord referred to in the introduction to this
chapter, as the Lord is seen to be supervising and overseeing the process of
creation.

Ignorant fools are unaware that I (Krishna) am the Supreme being,
eternal and full of infinite, auspicious attributes. They insult Me by
considering Me as having a human like body (subject to decay and death).
(9.11)
Those with demoniac natures have their intellect clouded with
ignorance. Their desires for heaven will not be realized. Their rituals and
sacrifices are a wasted effort. They will not attain true spiritual knowledge
and they are senseless. (9.12)
Comments: while the Lord, who has infinite powers is responsible
for the creation, sustenance, and dissolution of the universe and for
granting physical bodies to all souls, why is it that some consider Him the
same as other human beings? And why are there no consequences for those
who are insulting the ever-compassionate Lord? These two verses provide
the answers. Ignorant ones look at the Lord’s incarnations such as Rama,
Vamana, Krishna etc., and assume that the Lord too has a human like body.
They are not able to comprehend the Lord’s infinite attributes and strength.
The reason for their ignorance is their innate nature, which the Lord
describes using the word ‘prakrutim’ (by nature). Some even have hatred
towards the Lord. Such demoniac people will not achieve any lasting
rewards or spiritual knowledge, and hence will not be able to perform any
activity that would lead to liberation.
In the epic [BMP] Bhagavata Maha Purana (7th canto, 7-1-32),
there is a discussion on Shishupala (the king of Chedi and a known
adversary of Krishna) who hurled many abuses at the Lord and was killed
by Him. As per BMP, ultimately Shishupala achieves moksha. Some
interpret this to mean that even those who constantly hate the Lord are
thinking about Him incessantly and hence are eligible for moksha. It is
clarified in Sri Madhwacharya’s [MBTN] verse 21-259, and BTN verse
7-1-32, that Shishupala had two separate souls resident in his body. One
was the pious soul of Jaya (one of the doorkeepers of the Lord’s abode) and
the other was that of a demon. Due to a curse, Jaya had to endure being in

230

The Bhagavad Gita

Shishupala’s body. When Shishupala was killed by Lord Krishna, Jaya
attained the Lord, while the demoniac soul was relegated to the eternal hell.

O Partha! Pious people know Me as the root cause of everything in
the universe and one who has a never-ending existence. They worship Me
single mindedly. (9.13)
Comments: If some view the Lord as human-like (as stated in verse
9.11), could that be due to the Lord having human like attributes? This
verse answers that question by stating that if that were so, even those with
divine nature should consider the Lord as human like. But that is not the
case. Those with divine nature know the Lord as being responsible for the
existence of all entities in the universe and that He Himself is not subject to
decay. They worship the Lord single mindedly. Sri Rayaru in GV explains
that the Lord is not subject to fourfold decay – (i) in the physical body
(as He has a transcendental body), (ii) in the soul (as no soul is subject to
decay), (iii) in attributes (as the Lord is full of infinite auspicious attributes)
and (iv) in happiness (as He is always devoid of misery). The concept of
fourfold decay was explained in verse 2.18. This verse describes true
knowledge (jnana) that is characteristic of pious souls.

Such pious souls worship Me (Krishna) in various ways – through
constant singing of My glories, through involvement in strict rituals such as
fasting, through constant meditation and through constant salutations to
Me. They strive hard to achieve spiritual knowledge and worship Me with
great devotion. (9.14)
Some seekers worship Me through the sacrifice of knowledge
(listening, analyzing, and contemplating on spiritual knowledge). Some
worship My primary form (Narayana), or My various forms (Vasudeva,
etc.) knowing that all these forms are identical and that I am omnipresent,
with infinite forms. (9.15)
Comments: In verse 9.13, it was stated that pious souls worship the
Lord with the knowledge that He has a never-ending existence. In these
two verses, the path of worship is described. Some worship the primary
form of the Lord as Narayana, others worship the various forms that
originated from Narayana such as the four forms of Aniruddha, Pradyumna,
Sankarshana, Vasudeva and the twenty-four forms that start from Keshava
(multifaceted worship). The Lord is same in all His forms. Further, the
Lord is different from other entities such as individual souls and inert
objects as indicated using the word prithak meaning different. Sri Rayaru in
GV indicates another interpretation of the multifaceted worship of the
Lord, and the different types of sacrifices performed by seekers, which was
stated previously in chapter 4 (4.25).

I am the action of sacrifice. I am the ritual of sacrifice. I am the

offered in sacrifice. I am the ritual fire. I am the offering. (9.16)
I am the father, mother, supporter, worshipful grandfather of this
universe. I am the subject of all knowledge and everything that is holy. I
am postulated by the primordial holy syllable ‘Om’ and the infinite
Vedas - Rik, Sama and Yajur (9.17)
Comments: In verse 9.1, the Lord resolves to impart to Arjuna both
general knowledge – jnana (obtainable through scriptures) and very,
special knowledge (vijnana) about the Lord Almighty. The Lord described
such general knowledge in 12 verses from 9.4 to 9.15. In the next four
verses 9.16 to 9.19, the Lord teaches special, divine knowledge (vijnana)
which identifies the Lord’s presence in all entities, all activities, all sounds
and indeed in everything.
In verse 9.16, the Lord states His presence in all activities and
entities that pertain to a seeker performing a fire ritual to please Him. By
stating that He was the ritual of sacrifice, the Lord is indicating that He
controls and stimulates the act of a seeker performing a fire ritual.
Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that one should not attach peripheral
meaning to the activities and entities indicated here, but rather focus on
their hidden, inner, spiritual meaning. With this approach the activities and
entities where the Lord indicates His presence and ownership are as
follows: father = responsible for one’s birth; mother = responsible for one’s
birth; supporter = supports and sustains the universe; grandfather = worthy
of worship; knowable = worthy of being known; holy = cause of holiness in
holy objects; symbol Om = full of infinite, auspicious attributes;
rik = worthy of respect; sama = Equal presence in His various forms;
yajur = worshipped by everyone.

I am the destination (for those seeking liberation). I provide for

friend for everyone. Creation is from Me. Dissolution is from Me. I am the
cause for the existence of everyone and everything. I am the imperishable,
primordial seed. (9.18)
Comments: In this verse the Lord continues to identify some major
activities, entities, and attributes that He is responsible for. In many
instances those who achieve liberation are referred to as having reached the
Lord. In this verse, the Lord states that He is indeed the destination for
those seeking liberation. The Lord is also known as nidhana, meaning ‘one
into whom the universe dissolves’. In verse 9.7, it is stated that the universe
dissolves into nature. Sri Rayaru clarifies in GV, that as nature itself is
supported by the Lord, it is appropriate for the Lord to be identified with
the act of dissolution. The Lord also uses the qualifier avyayam when
referring to the primordial seed, to distinguish the Lord’s nature as being
imperishable, in comparison with the seed in the material world that is
subject to change and destruction. Sri Raghuttama Teertha in his PDBB
clarifies that the word ‘nivāsaḥ’ (refuge) here applies to those who are
already liberated and those who are seeking liberation.

234

The Bhagavad Gita

Comments: The Lord identifies His role in granting powers to
entities, such as heat and light, to the Sun. The Lord is also known as sat
and asat. Sri Rayaru explains two different sets of interpretations for these
words. Sat and asat mean ‘group of activities’ and ‘the reason for the group
of activities’, respectively. Sat also means one who is supreme. The Lord is
also known as asat, as this refers to one for whom there is no superior
entity. This interpretation is supported by Shabda Nirnaya as indicated by
Sri Madhwacharya in GTN.

They indulge in enjoying luxuries in expansive heavenly worlds, and
after exhausting their credits from good deeds (punya), are reborn in this
world. Focused only on the superficial aspects of the Vedas, they perform
rituals seeking heavenly pleasure and are stuck in this cycle. (9.21)

Chapter 9

235

Comments: In the next few verses, the Lord explains the difference
in rewards experienced by ritualists (those who perform Vedic rituals with
the expectation of specific outcomes), and His unconditional devotees.
Later, verse 9.24 indicates that the Lord consumes the fruits of all rituals
whether they are performed by ritualists or unconditional devotees. If that
is so, why is there a difference in the final reward? The difference is due to
the approach and attitude in performing such rituals. Ritualists perform
Vedic rituals to propitiate other deities with the expectation of rewards such
as worldly riches while on earth, heavenly worlds hereafter etc. They do
submit all rituals to the Lord Himself, but their activities are not without
expectation. On the other hand, unconditional devotees of the Lord perform
all activities as an offering to the Lord with utmost devotion and without
any expectations. The difference in final rewards is due to the difference in
their approach. Previously in verse 7.23, it was indicated that ritualists only
experience temporary fruits. These two verses clarify the meaning of
temporary fruits by stating that ritualists do reach the heavenly worlds
hereafter, enjoy the privileges there and after exhaustion of credits
eventually return to earth (in another birth).

Some exclusively worship Me with devotion, leaving aside all other

Comments: This verse explains the rewards experienced by
unconditional devotees of the Lord. They worship the Lord single mindedly
without any expectations. The Lord grants them permanent bliss. This is
indicated using the phrase ‘yoga kshema’ where yoga refers to attaining
something that one does not yet possess, and kshema refers to the state of
retaining what is attained. Sri Rayaru in GV explains that yoga here refers

236

The Bhagavad Gita

to attaining liberation (state of bliss) and kshema refers to retaining that
state permanently (eternal bliss).
This verse is identified as the single verse that represents this entire
chapter by Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in his BGS, as unconditional
devotion to the Lord is the ultimate form of prayer that a seeker needs to
perform to achieve liberation.

O Son of Kunti! Those who worship other deities with sincerity are

(9.23)
I am indeed the consumer as well as the Lord of all worships and
sacrifices. Those who are ignorant of this principle, propitiate other deities
and keep going back and forth between this mundane world and the
heavenly world. (9.24)
Those who propitiate heavenly deities reach the respective deities.
Those who worship the ancestral deities reach them as well. However,
those who worship Me exclusively reach My abode, never to return. (9.25)
Comments: These verses clarify that even for those who only
worship other deities, the fruits of their worship are granted by the Lord
Himself, as He is the ultimate object and controller of all worships and

Chapter 9

237

sacrifices. Given that the Lord is indeed the object of all worship, why is
there a difference in the rewards for ritualists and unconditional devotees?
The difference is due to the approach of these two types of worshippers.
What is the reason for the difference in their approach? Verse 9.24 states
that ritualists are not fully aware that the Lord is indeed the object of all
worship, which causes them to approach other deities for quick results.
Further, verse 9.25 clarifies that ritualists reach the heavenly abodes of the
respective deities of their propitiation.

Whatever a devotee offers Me with sincere devotion, whether it is a
leaf, a flower, some fruit, or water, I accept such devout offerings of the
striving souls. (9.26)
Comments: As the Lord is supreme and is the eventual object of all
worship and sacrifices, is it possible that ritualists view the worship of the
Lord Almighty as exceedingly difficult and hence propitiate other, lesser
deities? This verse clarifies that there is no difficulty involved in
worshipping the Lord who does not expect any grand worship. He expects
sincerity and unconditional devotion. Anything offered by such devotees
even if it is a leaf or a flower or a fruit or even water is gladly accepted by
the Lord. This again proves that the attitude of ritualists in resorting to
indirect worship of the Lord is due to their lack of understanding of His
true attributes.
In great epics such as the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, and the
Bhagavata, the Lord is seen accepting with pleasure even ordinary
substances such as a leftover leaf (as in the case of Draupadi) or a flower
(as in the case of Gajendra) or a fruit (as in the case of Shabari). Sri
Vidyamanya Teertha in his GPM offers an interesting interpretation of this

238

The Bhagavad Gita

verse. Leaf here refers to the Vedas (as per Gita (15.1) where the Vedas are
compared to the leaf of a Banyan tree which represents the universe) and
hence worship with a leaf means worshipping the Lord through proper
understanding of the Vedas. Flower refers to non-violence among the eight
flowers that are dear to the Lord as per the scriptural saying ahimsa
prathamam pushpam. The other seven flowers are - self-control,
compassion to all beings, forgiveness, knowledge, penance, truth, and
dhyana meditation. Offering some fruit refers to the act of performing
duties without any expectations of rewards. Offering water refers to the
teary eyes that one experiences because of intense, unconditional prayer to
the Lord.

By doing this you will not be bound by the effects of activities,

bondage and reach My abode. (9.28)
Comments: In verse 9.26, it was stated that the Lord is easy to
please and will accept even ordinary substances offered with sincerity and
devotion. Verse 9.27 states that in addition to whatever material substances
one offers to the Lord, it is also important to submit any worshipful

Chapter 9

239

activities that are performed such as ritual sacrifice, charity, austerity etc.,
also as an offering to the Lord. Doing so will release a devotee from any
side effects from activities performed and will pave the way for liberation.
Verse 9.28 describes the attributes of bondage (bandha) and
liberation (moksha) which are part of the eight attributes indicated earlier.

I treat all beings equally. I have no friends or enemies. Those who

(9.29)
Comments: The Lord treats everyone impartially with equality.
Equality here implies reciprocity. The Lord’s grace is proportional to one’s
devotion and likewise, His wrath is also proportional to one’s misdeeds.
The Lord never hates sincere devotees and likewise, He never protects
enemies who knowingly hate Him.

Such a person will immediately focus his/her mind back on righteous

devotees will never be harmed. (9.31)

240

The Bhagavad Gita

Comments: The supremacy of devotion is exemplified in these
verses. A similar concept was discussed previously in verse 4.36 where it
was indicated that right knowledge will absolve even those who are
indulging in misdeeds. Here the Lord is clarifying that such people who
have conviction in the Lord Almighty’s supremacy over all other deities
and indeed over everything in the universe, will soon get back on the right
track and achieve His grace. The discussion here applies to pious souls who
due to various reasons such as a curse have strayed onto the wrong path.
Souls eligible for liberation who have indulged in sinful activities
will have to pay for their misdeeds (such as misery in hell) but due to their
innate nature will eventually get back to the right path, develop devotion to
the Lord and achieve liberation. Sri Rayaru [GV] clarifies that deities and
sages who by nature are pious (sattvic) may also indulge in misdeeds. This
could happen when they have accumulated positive credits (punya) beyond
their eligibility. They would then experience a reduction in such credits by
indulging in misdeeds out of compulsion such as a curse. They would
however not have to experience hell as their misdeeds were beyond their
control.

O Partha! Even those who, due to sins committed in previous births
or due to a curse, are born in less hospitable, disadvantageous
environments, will achieve eternal bliss through their faith in Me. (9.32)
It is obvious that those who are born in virtuous families and holy
environments will reach Me through their faith. As you are in this
transitory, distressful world, worship Me without delay to reach your
spiritual goal. (9.33)

Chapter 9

241

Comments: Every soul has natural attributes based on which it
would take birth to play a specific role in society. Sometimes due to sins
committed in prior births or due to a curse, it is possible for someone to be
born in less hospitable, disadvantageous circumstances where they might
not have easy access to education, spiritual learning etc. Even those souls
can achieve liberation through faith and unflinching devotion to the Lord. It
goes without saying that others who are fortunate to have been born in
advantageous circumstances (such as birth in pious families, kingly
families etc.) are able to access spiritual education, develop faith in the
Lord and achieve liberation. Krishna advises Arjuna to make use of the
opportunity of his human birth in this transitory and distressful world and
perform his prescribed duties with devotion to Him without delay. This is a
message that applies to the entire human race.

Focus your mind exclusively on Me (Krishna). Be devoted only to
Me. Worship only Me. Surrender to Me through prostration. Thus, by
depending exclusively on Me, you will reach My abode. (9.34)
Comments: The Lord concludes the discussion in this unique
chapter by exhorting Arjuna to focus his mind, and worship, propitiate and
honour Him exclusively. The reward for such exclusive devotion to the
Lord is liberation (mukti). As this chapter was focused on the discussion of
the Lord’s special attributes, in the concluding verse the Lord encourages
Arjuna to develop devotion to Him after getting convinced about His
greatness.

242

The Bhagavad Gita

Summary of Chapter 9
While the Lord has infinite auspicious forms, attributes, activities
etc., there are eight activities of the Lord that directly impact living beings.
These are – creation (srishti), sustenance (sthiti), dissolution (laya),
regulation (niyamana), knowledge (jnana), ignorance (ajnana), bondage
(bandha), and liberation (moksha). Together they are called Janmadi
ashtaka and they are covered in this chapter. This chapter is called ‘Raja
Vidya Yoga’ as it teaches these important concepts about the Lord. The
Lord provides the context for the teachings in this chapter in verses 9.1,
9.2, and 9.3 where He resolves to impart both general knowledge (acquired
through scriptures - jnana) and special, divine knowledge about Himself
(vijnana). The attribute of sthiti (sustenance) among the eight major
attributes of the Lord as they relate to living beings is covered in verses
9.4 – 9.6. In verses 9.7 and 9.8, the Lord’s attributes of creation (srishti)
and dissolution (laya) are covered and in 9.10, His attribute of regulation
(niyamana) of the universe is discussed. Verse 9.13 describes the attribute
of knowledge (jnana) as it pertains to pious souls, and verses 9.11, 9.12
pertain to the attribute of false knowledge (ajnana) of demoniac souls. In
verse 9.1, the Lord resolved to impart Arjuna both jnana the general
knowledge obtainable through scriptures and very special knowledge about
Himself (vijnana). The Lord describes such general knowledge in 12 verses
from 9.4 to 9.15 and in four verses 9.16 to 9.19, the Lord instructs special,
divine knowledge (vijnana) which identifies His presence in all entities, all
activities, all sounds and indeed in everything. In verses 9.20 to 9.25, the
Lord explains the difference in rewards experienced by ritualists (those
who perform Vedic rituals with expectations on outcome), and His

Chapter 9

243

unconditional devotees. The supremacy of the path of devotion is described
in verses 9.26 – 9.29. Verse 9.28 alludes to the attributes of bondage
(bandha) and liberation (moksha). Verses 9.30 – 9.31 state that even if
pious souls indulge in misdeeds (due to some compulsion such as a curse)
they will eventually get back to the right path and move towards liberation.
In 9.34 the Lord concludes this chapter by instructing Arjuna to focus his
mind exclusively on Him, since performing prescribed duties with
unconditional devotion will lead one to liberation.

Chapter 10 - Divine Manifestations
Chapter Introduction: Number ten signifies fullness. It is very
fitting that the Lord details His greatness in this tenth chapter of 42 verses.
In the 6th chapter, the Lord provided details of dhyana meditation, and in
the last verse of Chapter 9 the Lord taught that one should concentrate and
focus the mind exclusively on Him to achieve everlasting bliss (moksha).
For one to develop such firm conviction in meditation, one needs to be
fully aware of the Lord’s greatness and attributes. It is also necessary for
one to develop a mental picture of the Lord to focus the mind during
meditation. The Lord details many of His glorious forms from verse 10.21
to 10.38, to aid in meditation. Some of the Lord’s attributes and special
presence in activities and entities were briefly described in 5.29, 7.8, 9.16
etc. More details on these concepts are provided in this grand chapter.

will delight in them. (10.1)
Comments: The Lord clarifies that Arjuna, being of a pious nature,
values knowing about His greatness and will listen to His sermon
attentively. Hence, the Lord chose Arjuna to teach about His paramount
attributes.

Even groups of deities and great sages do not have complete
knowledge of My paramount qualities or about the creation of this
universe. I am the reason for the existence of all deities, all sages and
indeed every being, and I am beginningless. (10.2)
Comments: The Lord states that even deities and great sages do not
know about His greatness and powers completely, which implies that no
one in the universe knows the Lord fully. While He is the cause for the
creation of the universe and indeed for everyone’s existence, the Lord
Himself has no creator. He existed always and will continue to exist
forever. Sri Rayaru in GV cautions that one should not conclude that the
reason for not knowing about His beginning is due to the difficulty in
obtaining such knowledge. The fact is that He is birthless and He always
existed. This is different from the incomplete knowledge that one has about
His act of creation which occurred, but one cannot completely comprehend.
Sri Rayaru provides three interpretations based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GB
for the phrase ‘na me vidhuhu’ (no one knows Me) as follows - (i) deities
and great sages do not understand My greatness fully; (ii) deities and great
sages do not understand My act of the creation of the universe completely;
(iii) deities and great sages do not fully understand that I have no
beginning. Sri Rayaru also quotes a Brahma Sutra (2.3.9) which states
that the Lord is birthless and hence has no beginning.

One who knows Me as eternal, is not subject to birth. The controller

will be freed from all sins. (10.3)

246

The Bhagavad Gita

Comments: The word anadi has an interesting interpretation by Sri
Rayaru in GV. A superficial meaning of anadi is one without beginning.
However, the Lord precedes this word by ajam (one without birth), which
also means one without beginning. Dividing the word anadi as ana and adi
leads to two interpretations. Ana means activity, adi is beginning, so anadi
means the one who is the cause of activity in everyone. Also, ana means
the deity mukhya prana (vayudeva) and hence anadi can also be interpreted
as the one who existed even before the deity mukhya prana. This
interpretation is also consistent with the Vedic quote in the Purusha
Sookta which states – pranaad vayur ajayatha (during the process of
creation, the deity Vayudeva arose out of the Lord’s breath).

I alone provide all the qualities to living beings such as intelligence,

birth, death, fear, fearlessness, non-violence, equanimity under pleasure or
pain, contentment, austerity, charity, fame, infamy and so on. (10.4) (10.5)
Comments: After having declared Himself as the subject of
knowledge that leads one to liberation, the Lord describes the various
attributes and emotions that He equips all living beings with, to help them
in their livelihood and spiritual journey. The Lord not only provides living
beings with physical bodies and sense organs to conduct their lives, He also
enables them with various faculties and emotions to complete their
personalities.

During the period of the previous Manu, I created the seven great
sages, the deities who emanated from the mind of Brahma, and the four
Manu deities. Their progeny in turn populated the universe. (10.6)
Comments: The Lord stated previously that He is the cause for the
creation of all living beings. Here He is describing the details of such a
creation. The Lord initially created the seven great sages (Mareechi, Atri,
Angeerasa, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Vasishta). Sri Rayaru in GV explains
that Manu also means one endowed with knowledge and hence Manu
deities also are all deities starting from four faced Brahma. The Lord
initially created Brahma and through him all other deities were created. The
progeny of the seven sages and the deities then populated the universe. The
reference to four types of Manu deities indicates the categorization of
deities into four categories like human beings described previously in
chapter 4 (4.13). Brahmanas, kshatriyas, vyshyas and shudras are the four
classes of deities. Brahma belongs to the category of Brahmana. Deities
such as Vayudeva, Seshadeva, Rudradeva, Garuda, Indra are Kshatriyas
etc. It was clarified in 4.13 that the four categories in society are based on
the innate nature and talent of souls and, no category is superior to another.
In fact 4.13 uses the word varna which means colour. Thus, the four
categories are different like colours are different and one should not
confuse them with the caste system prevalent in society. The fact that these
types of categories exist even among deities is proof that one should not
grade people based on their classification.

in verses 10.2 to 10.6 and in this verse He declares that one who properly
understands His majesty and supremacy will develop the ability for
concentrated meditation on Him, which eventually leads to liberation.

with others, dance and rejoice in My glory while feeling fully contented.
(10.9)
Comments: In these verses, the Lord describes the way learned ones
identified in verse 10.7 worship and serve Him. Learned ones not only
rejoice in their divine knowledge, but they also impart such knowledge to
others and engage in spiritual discussions to help others develop conviction
in the Lord’s activities, greatness, and prowess.

For those who immerse their minds in Me and worship Me with
affection, I grant wisdom with which they can attain My abode. (10.10)
Comments: In this verse the Lord states that He rewards His
devotees with the knowledge and wisdom they need to achieve liberation.
His devotees who worship Him with single minded focus (described in
verses 10.7 – 10.9), having understood His greatness (summarized in verses
10.2 – 10.6), are accordingly rewarded.
This verse is identified as the summary of this entire chapter by Sri
Madinur Vishnu Teertha in his BGS as it summarizes the reward for a
seeker who truly understands the Lord’s prowess. This is also explained in
more detail in later verses.
Author’s Note: There is a curious mathematical aspect to this verse.
This 10th verse in this 10th chapter has 10 words! It was stated in the
introduction that the number 10 stands for fullness. Also, 10*10*10 = 1000
symbolizes the 1000 names of the Lord as in the Vishnu Sahasra Nama. It
is very apt that this verse is the summary of this chapter.

(10.11)
Comments: In addition to rewarding His ardent devotees with
knowledge to achieve liberation, the Lord states that He frees their minds
and shatters any ill-feelings and misery. After all, for one to develop a deep
conviction in divine knowledge, one’s mind must be freed from misery,
prejudice, and other negative emotions.

You have also taught me the same. (10.12) (10.13)
O Keshava! I trust everything you have said to me. O Lord! Neither
great deities nor demons, nor indeed any others know you fully. O
Purushottama! Controller of the universe, and Lord of everyone and
everything. Only you know yourself fully. (10.14) (10.15)

Please educate me about your divine majestic forms with which you
pervade this universe. O Lord of Infinite Abilities! How should I be
thinking about you? O Supreme Lord! How do I visualize you and your
presence in different entities in this universe? O Janardana! Tell me more
details about your supreme abilities and majestic forms. I will never be
satisfied with any amount of your sweet nectarine words. (10.16) (10.17)
(10.18)
Comments: After hearing about the Lord’s greatness and attributes
in brief, Arjuna is now curious and interested in learning more. He states
that great sages and deities have praised the Lord’s attributes and the Lord
Himself has reiterated them. Further, Arjuna knows that even great deities
are not capable of fully knowing the Lord who is the creator of even
Brahma and Rudra (indicated by the use of the Lord’s name Keshava in
10.14, where ka refers to Brahma and Isha refers to Rudra, and Keshava is
in fact the one who created both Brahma and Rudra). Only the Lord knows
His forms fully. Arjuna further states that for one to meditate on the Lord, it
is important for one to visualize His forms. Hence, Arjuna would like to
learn about the Lord’s majestic forms. In 10.16, Arjuna requests the Lord to
teach him fully about His forms. Arjuna is never satisfied with any amount
of the sweet nectarine words of the Lord. In 10.16, Arjuna uses the term
vibhuti while referring to the Lord’s form. Sri Rayaru in GV explains that
vibhuti has two different meanings. Firstly, vibhuti = vividhatayaa
bhootayaha meaning different forms of the Lord such as Rama, Krishna
etc., and secondly vibhuti = vishishtaha bhootayaha, meaning the form of
the Lord that bestows superiority to a specific entity or quality among its
peers. These will be detailed in later verses.

O Gudakesha (Arjuna, one who has conquered sleep)! I am
omnipresent, I exist in the hearts of all living beings, and I power their
existence. I am responsible for the creation, sustenance, and dissolution of
all beings. (10.20)
Comments: The Lord is pleased with Arjuna’s sincerity and
curiosity and resolves to teach him about His majestic forms. The Lord
confirms that He has infinite forms. This seems to be in response to
Arjuna’s request in 10.16, where he wanted to learn about the Lord’s forms
fully (without leaving anything out). After all, not even great deities know
fully about the Lord’s forms or attributes. In 10.20, the Lord states that
while He has special presence in many entities, He is present in everyone’s
hearts, and He is the cause for the creation, the sustenance, and the
dissolution of the universe.
In the next 18 verses from 10.21 to 10.38, the Lord explains in detail
His specific, majestic forms. This group of verses is one of the most
important parts of the Gita.
Sri Rayaru in GV explains that vibhuti roopa (divine manifestations)
are of two types – direct forms and hidden forms. The Lord describes both
types of manifestations. Direct form refers to His forms of Rama, Krishna,
Vyasa, Kapila etc., while the hidden forms refer to the Lord’s form resident
in specific objects that gives them supremacy. The hidden forms are of
three types: (i) supreme among similar objects, (ii) supreme among
dissimilar objects which share a common condition, and (iii) supreme
among objects except for an obvious leader. These categories are identified

Chapter 10

253

in Sri Madhwacharya’s GTN referring to an ancient work, the Vibhuti
Tattva. These categories will be identified in later verses. Also, Sri Rayaru
uses shabda nishpatti (word derivation) to indicate the specific attribute of
the Lord signified by the name of the chosen superior entity in each class.

Among the twelve Adityas, I am Vishnu. Among all radiant objects,
I am Ravi (Sun). I am Marichi among the Marut deities. I am The Moon
among the constellations of the stars in the night sky (Resident in the Sun,
Marichi, and the Moon, I grant them superiority among their peers). (10.21)
Comments: Among the twelve children of Aditi, the Lord is Vishnu
(Vishnu = vyaptatvaat sarveshu pratishtatvaat = the one who pervades the
universe and is resident in all). Among all luminous objects, He is Ravi
(rashmi yukto = one who is full of infinite glow). Among the 49 Marut
deities He is Marichi (marinam charayati = the one who moves clouds).
Among stars, He is Shashi/Moon (shashaha asya aasteeti = one who is full
of happiness).
In this verse, one can see examples of the different categories of the
Lord’s manifestations. Vishnu is one of His direct manifestations. The
other three entities identified – Ravi, Marichi, Shashi are indirect
manifestations. Also, Ravi (Sun) is chosen as supreme among similar
radiant entities, while Shashi (the Moon) is indicated as supreme among the
stars. The Moon is not a star. However, it is the brightest object in the night
sky. This is an example of a superior object among dissimilar objects
(Moon and Stars) that share a common condition (the night sky). The
Lord’s special presence in the chosen superior object is signified by the
Lord’s attribute as explained by Sri Rayaru in GV through word derivation.
For example, Ravi is the worldly name one uses for the Sun, but primarily
Ravi means the one who is full of infinite glow, a reference to the Lord
Almighty. This discussion applies to all other superior forms as well.

who is the cause of happiness), Vittesha (owner of all wealth), Pavaka
(purifier of everything) and Meru (one who is not activated by some other

the universe out of Himself during creation) and Sagara (as He is the
consumer of the essence in all substances and activities).

Comments: He is known as Bhrighu (the one who eviscerates
enemies). He is called Akshara (the one not subject to four-fold decay as
described in 2.18). He is Japa (the one who protects anyone born) and
Himalaya (the one who is the shelter for the two forms of Lakshmi – hree
and shree). In 10.23, Meru was recognized as the supreme among mountain
peaks but in this verse, Himalaya is identified as supreme among all
immovables.

Comments: The Lord is known as Ashwattha (the one with a horse
like face in the form of Hayagreeva, as Ashwa means horse). He is Narada
(the one who fulfills the wishes of humans as nara means human). He is
known as Chitraratha (the one with the spectacular chariot as ratha means
chariot). Among sages He is Kapila who is a direct form of the Lord
Almighty where kapila means one who is the embodiment of happiness,

256

The Bhagavad Gita

protects the universe and dissolves it within Himself during the great
dissolution (ka means happiness, pi which leads to palana means one who
protects and la which leads to laya means one who absorbs the universe
during dissolution).
HH Sri Vidyasagara Madhava Teertha offers another unique
derivation for the word Kapila as kapi + la where, kapi indicates monkey
like unsteadiness and la stands for layati (destruction). Thus, Kapila can
also be interpreted as the attribute of the Lord Almighty who destroys the
monkey like unsteadiness in His devotees minds.

known as vishwato mukha (one with many faces) with the same name as
He spans the entire universe. He is also known as Dhata (one who supports

Gayatri = gayat + trati (the one who protects those who sing His praises),
Margasheersha = margaanam + sheersha (the one who is at the pinnacle of

evil and wisdom in the pious).
Note that in the Sama Veda, where the verses from the Rig Veda are
set to musical score, there are different types of singing such as
rarthantara, vairoopa, brihat etc. Among them, the Lord resides in the
brihat type of sama singing with the same name, Brihatsama.

the qualities of Jaya (the one who is ever victorious), Vyavasaya (the one
who is resident in the quality of enterprise), and Sattvam (the one who
gives purity to the pious).
It must be noted that the Lord is not responsible for one indulging in
gambling which is recognized as one of the vices that is to be avoided. It is
just that even among the sinners, the Lord enables their activity which is as
per their innate nature.

the one who has a special existence). This is a direct form of the Lord. He
is also known as Ushana Kavi (the one who has an interest in the act of
creation). This is also the name of Shukracharya, a great scholar.

262

The Bhagavad Gita

is known as silence/Mouna (the one who is worshipped by Manu deities).
He is known as Jnana (the one who regulates knowledge).
Thus in 18 verses from 10.21 to 10.38, the Lord describes His presence
in various entities and objects giving them superiority among their peers.
Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that the Lord has identified some entities as
having His special presence though they were not the obvious leaders in
those categories. These are  Samaveda in 10.22, where Rig Veda is known as the superior among
the Vedas.
 Vasava (deity Indra) in 10.22, where Lakshmi, Brahma etc., are
known to be superior to Indra.
 japa (meditation) among ways of worship in 10.25, where jnana
(worship through knowledge) is known to be superior among ways
of worship.
 vajra (diamond) among weapons in 10.28, where chakra (disc) is
known to be superior among weapons.
 ushana (Shukracharya) among scholars in 10.37, where deity
Brahma is known to be superior among scholars.
 Dhananjaya (Arjuna) among the Pandavas in 10.37, where Bheema
is known to be superior among the Pandavas.
As per Sri Madhwacharya’s GTN, the above entities are identified as
having the special presence of the Lord as cases to illustrate their
superiority among other subcategories within a main category. This was
explained in the comment section of verses 10.19 and 10.20, where it was
stated that the supremacy of the Lord among His hidden forms is of three
types: (i) supreme among similar objects, (ii) supreme among dissimilar
objects who share a common condition, and (iii) supreme among objects
except for an obvious leader. For example, among deities, after the Lord,
the order of gradation is Sri Lakshmi, Brahma, Vayu, Saraswathi, Bharati,
Sesha, Garuda, Rudra, Varuni, Sowparni, Parvati and then Indra. However,
Indra is superior among the deities in Swarga Loka (heaven).

the universe, sentient or inert. While He has special presence in some
objects giving them superiority in their respective categories, such as the
Sun (Ravi) among glowing objects, one should not assume that the Lord is
not resident in other glowing objects.

divine manifestations in verses 10.21 to 10.38, the Lord declares here that
His forms are infinite, implying that no one can completely comprehend
Him.

Comments: The Lord further clarifies that the supremacy in any
attribute or quality visible in any entity is due only to an infinitesimal
fraction of the Lord’s special presence in them. Hence, the Sun (Ravi) who
is supreme among all glowing objects exhibits such supremacy due to the
presence of a minute fraction of the Lord’s glory. This is different from the
Lord’s direct forms identified in these verses such as Vishnu, Rama,
Kapila, Vyasa, and Krishna.

O Arjuna! What use is it for you to know about My majestic forms?
I pervade and support the entire universe with a minute fraction of My
glory. (10.42)
Comments: The intent of the Lord’s question is to caution Arjuna
(and everyone else) that one should not conclude that His forms are limited
to those identified in this chapter as they represent a miniscule fraction of
His infinite forms. There will be more description about the Lord’s
pervasiveness in future chapters. This chapter is a prelude to the glorious
universal form of the Lord which will be covered in the next chapter.
Summary of Chapter 10
In this chapter, the Lord details His forms and presence in many
entities, attributes in response to Arjuna’s questions which appeared in
verses 10.12 to 10.18. Arjuna was keen to learn about the Lord’s divine
glories and countless manifestations as one needs to form a mental image
of the Lord to visualize Him during concentrated meditation. The Lord
identifies His divine manifestations and special presence in entities which
gives them superiority. These are described in 18 verses from 10.21 to
10.38. Sri Rayaru in GV explains that vibhuti roopa (divine manifestation)
is of two types – direct forms and hidden forms. Direct form refers to His
forms of Vishnu, Rama, Krishna, Vyasa, Kapila etc., while hidden forms

Chapter 10

265

refer to the Lord’s presence in specific entities that gives them supremacy.
The superiority among the hidden forms are of three types: (i) supreme
among similar objects, (ii) supreme among dissimilar objects which share a
common condition, and (iii) supreme among objects except for an obvious
leader. Also, Sri Rayaru uses shabda nishpatti (word derivation) to indicate
the specific attribute of the Lord signified by the name of the chosen
superior entity in each class. In verse 10.21, He identifies Ravi (sun) as the
entity that is superior among similar objects, namely luminaries. In the
same verse, the Lord also identifies Shashi (Moon) as superior among stars.
The Moon is not a star. However, the Moon and the stars share the common
attribute of being visible in the night sky. In that sense, the Moon is
superior to the stars. This is an example of an entity that is superior among
dissimilar objects. In verse 10.22, He identifies sama veda as superior
among the Vedas. However, it is well known that Rig veda is the superior.
So, the interpretation here is that the Lord is identifying Sama veda among
the Vedas except for the obvious leader (namely Rig Veda). This is also
seen in verse 10.25, where the Lord identified japa (meditation) as superior
among the forms of worship where one knows that jnana (knowledge) is
the supreme form. In addition to such entities (both sentient and inert such
as mountains, rivers etc.), the Lord also signifies His presence in qualities
and attributes such as fame, memory, intellect, tolerance etc., as seen in
verse 10.34, and also in activities such as gambling in 10.36. In verse
10.16, Arjuna had requested the Lord to teach him completely about His
majestic forms and manifestations, and after describing His divine
manifestations in verses 10.21 to 10.38, the Lord declares in verse 10.40,
that His forms are infinite, implying that no one can completely
comprehend Him. The Lord concludes His sermon on His majestic forms
by cautioning Arjuna that he should not assume that the Lord’s various
forms are limited to those described in this chapter because they are infinite
and expansive. This is a prelude to the description of the Lord’s universal
form (next chapter).

Chapter 11 - The Lord’s Universal Form
Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 55 verses is termed Vishwa
Roopa Darshanam (The Lord’s Universal Form). In the concluding verse
of the previous chapter, the Lord declares that He has presence in
everything in the universe and just a minute fraction of His energy causes
superiority in many objects. The Lord also indicates that previous teachings
provide only a glimpse of His powers. This chapter conveys more details
about His forms. After listening to the Lord’s teachings on His divine
manifestations, His amazing activities in terms of creation of the universe
etc., Arjuna is naturally curious to behold the Lord’s omnipotent form. The
Lord grants Arjuna’s wish by giving him Divine Vision before exhibiting
His grand, Universal form which is the quintessential feature of this
chapter. The description of the Lord’s Universal Form mirrors the
description in the Purusha Sookta (the Nature of Cosmic Being), from the
Rig Veda which is considered the primordial group of hymns that gave rise
to the entire span of Vedic literature. In that sense this chapter is like a
commentary on the Purusha Sookta. This chapter also has a soulful prayer
by Arjuna on seeing the Lord’s universal form. While the Lord had
previously taught Arjuna about His greatness and attributes, the act of
physically seeing the Lord’s universal form completely solidifies Arjuna’s
conviction in Sri Krishna’s teachings.

Arjuna said: O Krishna! Out of compassion, You blessed me with
the most secret divine knowledge. My ignorance is dispelled by Your
words. (11.1)
O Krishna, One with Lotus Eyes! I understood about the cycle of
births and deaths of living beings. I also learnt about Your infinite
greatness. (11.2)
O Supreme Lord! It is true that You taught me a lot about Your
attributes and forms. O Supreme among All Beings! I crave to have a
vision of Your great, unimaginable majestic form. (11.3)
O Lord of Yogas! If you feel that I can see Your form physically,
please show me Your Universal form that has no end. (11.4)
Comments: Arjuna, after hearing about the Lord’s divine
manifestations and His amazing activities, is now craving to have a vision
of the Lord’s form. After all, no amount of studying or listening about the
Lord can be compared to the experience of directly seeing the Lord. Also, a
direct vision of the Lord is extremely helpful for one during meditation.
Hence, Arjuna requests the Lord to grant him a vision of His magnificent
form. Arjuna also knows that the Lord is beyond the perception of sense
organs which he indicates by addressing the Lord as Prabhu in verse 11.4.
However, Arjuna also addresses the Lord as Yogeshwara (one who is the
master of all yogas - ways and means), implying that the Lord would guide
him on the sure path to a direct vision of His Supreme form. Arjuna
humbly requests the Lord in 11.4 that if He felt that he is eligible and

268

capable of seeing His imperishable form, then the Lord should grant him
that vision.

Comments: The Lord having been humbly prayed to by Arjuna,
resolves to grant Arjuna the vision of His magnificent Universal Form.
The reference to hundreds and thousands in 11.5 indicates innumerable or
infinite forms. The Lord displays all deities in His form as well as many
astonishing, indescribable entities that Arjuna has never seen before. He
also tells Arjuna to see in Him all entities in the universe and anything else
that he can imagine. In 11.8, the Lord confirms that Arjuna would not be
able to see His Universal Form with his normal eyes and that He would
grant Arjuna a pair of divine eyes to behold His Universal Form.

Lord Hari accedes to Arjuna’s request and displays His magnificent

meanings – the one who consumes the offerings from devotees’ sacrifices
and one who is coloured green). Those who had gathered in the battle
ground were able to view the Lord’s Universal form to the extent of their

The Lord’s Universal form has infinite faces, infinite eyes, infinite

The Lord’s Universal form is sporting divine garlands, divine

attributes (such as knowledge, bliss) with faces on all sides. (11.11)
That exalted Universal form has the brightness of thousands and
thousands (countless) of Suns rising altogether at the same time. (11.12)
Comments: Sanjaya describes the Lord’s form as seen by him. It
must be remembered that he is relaying the proceedings of the war to King
Dhrutarashtra, as Lord Vedavyasa had granted Sanjaya the ability to
visualize the war from a distance. Lord Vedavyasa is another form of Lord
Krishna, as per 10.37. So it is not a surprise that Sanjaya was also able to
visualize the Lord’s Universal form which otherwise was not visible to
normal human eyes. The description in 11.10 about the Lord’s attributes is
consistent with the one in the Purusha Sookta.
The fact that Arjuna was able to view the Lord’s Universal Form
with the entire universe in it, in the background of the battlefield, also
proves that the universe is indeed a real entity and not an illusion. Of
course, Arjuna required the Divine Vision granted to him by the Lord to
view the universe pervaded by Him.

Arjuna, at that time, saw the entire universe with its manifold
divisions, whirling inside the Universal form of Lord Krishna, the Lord of
all deities. (11.13)
Arjuna, trembling with tears in his eyes and immersed in
indescribable feelings, prostrated before the Lord, bowing his head, and
started praying. (11.14)
Comments: Arjuna, after viewing the Lord’s Universal Form in all
its glory, is overcome with emotion. He describes the Lord’s Universal
Form in the following 17 verses with tears of joy in his eyes.

different types of creatures. I can also see the four faced deity Lord
Brahma, and Lord Rudra sitting on his lap. I can see all the great sages and
divine serpents. (11.15)
Comments: The four faced deity Brahma shelters in the Lord
Almighty, Rudra similarly shelters in Brahma (symbolically indicated by
him sitting on deity Brahma’s lap). As per the epic Padma Purana, all
other deities are sheltered in various organs of Lord Rudra.

and discs, with resplendent glow of light like blazing Suns. Your incredible
forms are everywhere, and they seem to pierce my eyes. (11.17)
Comments: In verse 11.16, the use of the word sarvataha
(everywhere) indicates the Lord spanning all spaces. Space is infinite and
so is the Lord. The reference to the Lord’s infinite organs mirrors the
description in the Purusha Sookta.

Puranas. (11.18)
Comments: This verse indicates the eternal existence of the Lord as
the one who has no beginning, middle or end. While verse 11.16 referred to
the Lord spanning infinite space, this verse indicates the Lord spanning
infinite time.

Comments: While verses 11.16 and 11.18 made references to the
Lord spanning infinite spaces and times, this verse states that the Lord’s
attributes are also infinite. The reference to the Sun and the Moon mirrors
the description in the Purusha Sookta.

Your single form spreads from heaven to earth; it fills the interspace
and pervades in all directions. O Greatest of all souls! Your form is both
amazing and threatening. All Your devotees in all three worlds seem to be
petrified. (11.20)
Comments: The Lord’s form appears threatening as He prepares to
lift the burden Mother Earth is carrying. Evil doers are a burden on earth
and from time to time the Lord devises ways to lessen this load. The war of
the Mahabharata is one such instance. The Lord does appear cruel and
threatening to evil doers because they are guilty of wicked acts. Realised
souls such as Brahma, Rudra who are used to the vision of the Lord are not
threatened by this form. In Bhagavata [BMP], Canto 7, Prahlada was
praying to Lord Narasimha who had taken a frightening form while killing
the evil demon, Hiranyakashipu. Prahlada states that superior deities who
had gathered there (such as Brahma, Rudra) were not frightened by the
Lord’s form as they were realized souls and were used to viewing such
forms of the Lord.

Comments: Verse 11.15 described deities sheltered in the Lord and
in this verse, deities are described as entering and leaving the Lord’s form
at will. The reference in verse 11.15 is to deities who are not yet liberated,
and the reference in this verse is to deities who are liberated. This is
clarified by Sri Rayaru in GV following Sri Madhwacharya’s GTN
supported by the epic Brahmanda Purana.

ancestral deities. This is because these deities consume the vapours from
boiling water, hot cooked rice etc., offered by devotees.

O Krishna, Mighty Armed One! Your form is magnificent and huge.
It has infinite faces, eyes, shoulders, thighs, feet, abdomens and sharp tusk
and teeth. All three worlds are terrified and so am I. (11.23)
O Vishnu! Your form touches the sky, dazzling in many colours with
large glowing eyes and mouth wide open. Looking at this, my mind is full
of fear. I am trembling, unable to stay steady. (11.24)
O Lord of All Deities! Looking at Your infinite faces glowing like
the fire of universal destruction with extended, sharp, strong, piercing teeth,
I am losing my bearings. O Supporter of the Universe! Please have mercy
on me. (11.25)
Comments: Verse 11.23 refers to the Lord’s face, shoulders, thighs,
and feet. This is like the description in the Purusha Sookta where it was
stated that during the creation of the universe, four categories of population
with four different nature and qualities were born out of the Lord’s face,
shoulders, thighs, and feet. Verse 11.24 describes the Lord’s mouth as
being open since the Lord is preparing to destroy millions during the war
and consume them.

side are all seen running towards Your terrifying mouth which has

276

The Bhagavad Gita

dreadful, sharp teeth and many are seen with their heads smashed and stuck
between Your teeth. (11.26) (11.27)
Comments: The reference to the Kauravas and other warriors seen
entering the Lord’s open mouth, which has sharp, dreadful teeth is a
symbolic way of indicating their impending death in the war. A question
that arises currently is as follows. If the Gita was taught by Lord Krishna to
Arjuna before the start of the war, how could Arjuna see the vision of many
warriors dying in the war as indicated here. Sri Rayaru in GV explains that
Arjuna was granted Divine Vision by the Lord so that he could see the His
Universal Form. The same Divine Vision also gave Arjuna the ability to
see things that would happen in the future.
Sri Rayaru in GV explains that deities who have Divine Vision can
view things with infinite precision. In the epic Vishnu Dharma, there is an
episode related to King Puroorava and the Ashwini deities who visit him.
The King requests them to wait a short while as he wants to see them after
taking a shower and dressing himself in his royal clothes and ornaments.
The deities see him later and laugh at him. The King asks the deities the
reason for their reaction. They say that even though the King took just
some time to get himself dressed; he had grown a little older during that
time. The implication here is that though everyone grows old every minute
of the day, no one can see or feel the minute changes in their bodies. But
the Ashwini deities because of their divine eyesight were able to see even
the minutest change in the King’s body during the time that he took to dress
himself.

Just as currents of water from all rivers flood into the ocean, brave
warriors from this world are seen hurtling into Your burning mouth from
all directions. (11.28)
Just as moths crash into a blazing fire with great speed and perish,
many of these warriors are running into your mouth with great speed only
to get destroyed. (11.29)
Comments: These two verses identify the warriors who are shown
to be entering the Lord’s mouth as a symbolic way of describing their
imminent death. Verse 11.28 which refers to veera (brave) warriors seems
to be referring to sattvic warriors who are fighting for a just cause, and are
hurtling into the Lord’s mouth, just like rivers merging into a majestic
ocean, which is a natural event. Verse 11.29 describes warriors rushing into
their deaths just like moths rush towards a blazing fire. This seems to be
referring to evil warriors who by nature are drawn to sinful activities even
when they know the perils associated with such actions.

understand You better as You are the reason for the existence of this
Universe. I cannot understand Your ways. (11.31)

278

The Bhagavad Gita

Comments: Verse 11.30 describes the Lord’s form which is
terrifying and threatening. Arjuna who had heard about the Lord’s
compassionate qualities is perplexed. In verse 11.31, He states that while
the Lord has described His attributes and qualities earlier, he is unable to
understand why He is now displaying such a terrifying form.
Arjuna is a mere Instrument in the War

The Lord said: I am the controller of Time and Space, mighty
enough to destroy all the worlds, and I have resolved to destroy all these
warriors here. Excepting you and a few others, all these soldiers will perish.
(11.32)
Comments: Lord Krishna responds to Arjuna’s question about His
form and states that one of His activities is destruction of evil doers. The
Lord had declared previously in 4.7 and 4.8 that He would incarnate
Himself from time to time to protect virtuous lives and to destroy evil
doers. Such a time had come now where evil forces were controlling much
of Bharat and the Lord’s incarnation as Sri Krishna was designed to destroy
the evil and reestablish Dharma. The Lord assures Arjuna that most soldiers
would perish in the war with the exception of Arjuna himself and a few
others. The Lord uses the term ‘api’ meaning ‘also’ to indicate ‘others’
who will survive the war. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that ‘others’ refers to
Arjuna’s four brothers and three warriors from the other side,
Ashwatthama, Krutavarma and Krupacharya. This is as per the Souptika
Parva chapter of the Mahabharata.

O Savyasachi (Arjuna, the one who is ambidextrous)! Therefore, lift
yourself up and wage this just war. Defeat your enemies and achieve fame.
Enjoy the plentiful kingdom. All these warriors have already been killed by
Me. You are a mere instrument in this act of war. (11.33)
All brave warriors such as Bheeshma, Drona, Jayadratha, Karna have
already been killed by Me. You do not need to grieve. Wage the war and go
through the formality of killing them. You will be victorious in this war.
(11.34)
Comments: In verse 2.6, Arjuna had expressed doubts as to whether
he would win the war. The Lord had instructed him that he should wage the
war as it was his duty to do so. Lord Krishna had also stated in verse 2.37,
that Arjuna stood to gain regardless of victory or defeat in the war. If he
won, he would enjoy ruling the prosperous kingdom, and if he lost his life
he would attain heaven for diligently performing his prescribed duty. In
these verses, the Lord goes a step further and tells Arjuna that victory was a
certainty as He had already planned death for the Kauravas, and Arjuna had
only to go through the formality of fighting the war to preserve his fame. In
verse 11.34, the Lord explicitly names Kaurava warriors Bheeshma, Drona,
Jayadratha, and Karna as the ones whose deaths were preordained. Sri
Rayaru clarifies in GV that these warriors were protected with specific
boons that would have rendered them impossible to conquer, so Arjuna’s
apprehension about their invincibility was understandable. The Lord puts
Arjuna’s mind at ease by stating that even these warriors would perish in
the war (Later in the war, these warriors would encounter unique situations
where they would perish without contradicting the powers, they possessed
due to prior boons).

further developments in the war, Sanjaya states that Arjuna who was
terrified at the Lord’s magnificent but frightening form starts addressing the
Lord in a trembling voice. As will be seen later, Arjuna is also concerned
that he might have treated Krishna as just a normal friend without being
fully aware of His greatness, and this concern could also have led to
Arjuna’s fear.

Arjuna said: O Hrishikesha! The entire universe is dancing and
celebrating Your greatness. This is understandable. All evil demons are
running helter-skelter, and all deities such as groups of Siddhas are bowing
their heads to You. (11.36)
O Supreme Soul! How can one not bow before You as You are the
most supreme being who created even four faced Brahma? You are the One

Chapter 11

281

without end, Lord of all Lords, supporter of the Universe, and You are
imperishable. You are superior to every entity, manifest and unmanifest, in
the universe. (11.37)
Comments: Arjuna prays to the Lord with utmost humility. He
recounts the Lord’s greatness as the most superior being in the entire
universe and the one who created even four faced Brahma. All deities in the
universe bow before the Lord Almighty as they owe their existence to Him.
In verse 11.37, Arjuna uses the word Mahatma to address the Lord. Sri
Rayaru in GV refers to the scriptures and explains Mahatma as
mahat + atma where mahat indicates completeness and atma has four
meanings – the one who spans the entire universe, the one who accepts
whatever is offered by devotees, the one who consumes the essence of
acceptable offerings, and the one who is eternal.

You. (11.38)
You are - Vayu, Yama, Agni, Varuna, Chandra, Prajapati, and
grandfather to all. I offer my obeisance to You thousands of times, again
and again. (11.39)
Comments: In verse 11.38, Arjuna continues his prayer to the Lord.
The Lord is everywhere, always full of infinite, auspicious attributes. In

282

The Bhagavad Gita

verse 11.39, Arjuna describes the Lord as Vayu (form of strength and
wisdom), Yama (blemishless), Agni (activator of the inert Universe),
Varuna (accepts any offering from devotees), Chandra (full of bliss),
Prajapati (ruler of subjects) and Pitamaha (grandfather-father of Brahma
who himself is the father to all). He is indwelling in all these deities and He
powers their activities. The deities are in fact named after the Lord
indwelling in them as indicated by the meanings above.

I bow in front of You, from behind You and from all directions. You

Comments: In verse 11.39, Arjuna describes the Lord’s form as
intrinsically powering superior deities by the same name. Here Arjuna
extends that description to state that the Lord is everywhere and in
everything. He specifically addresses the Lord as ‘Sarva’ (one who is
everywhere). Sri Rayaru in GV explains that the definition of ‘Sarva’ stated
by Arjuna unambiguously clarifies that the reference to ‘Sarva’ in
scriptures such as the Chandogya Upanishat (3-14-1), the Taittireeya
(3-12) should be interpreted as referring to the Lord’s attribute of pervading
and spanning everywhere in the universe and should not be construed to
mean that the Lord Himself is the universe.

Without knowing Your greatness, thinking of You merely as my
friend, I have taken liberties and called You thus - Hey Krishna! Hey
Yadava! Hey, My Friend! - sometimes by mistake and sometimes in
affection. (11.41)
When relaxing, sleeping, sitting, and eating I have shown disrespect
by making fun of You. O Supreme One! You are full of infinite, auspicious
attributes. I beg You to forgive me. (11.42)
O Supreme Soul with Unending Abilities! You are the father of this
universe for both animate and inanimate objects. You are worthy of
worship by all. You are the greatest teacher. There is no one equal to You
in all three worlds. How can there be any one more superior? (11.43)
O Lord of Lords! As You are worthy of my worship, just like a
father is to a son, a friend to another friend, and a lover to a loved one,
please forgive all my mistakes. I beg You with all sincerity. (11.44)
Comments: In these verses, Arjuna expresses his remorse for taking
liberties when interacting with Krishna, being unaware of His greatness.
Normally when one is relaxing or sleeping, it is common for one to be in a
lighter mood. Arjuna is indicating to Krishna that during such light
moments he has treated Him as any other friend and might not have shown
Him proper respect. Arjuna is saying that his behaviour is partly due to his
ignorance about Krishna’s greatness and partly due to his friendship.
Normally, when one addresses elders, teachers etc., one would not directly
call them by their names, but would address them using respectful terms.

284

The Bhagavad Gita

Arjuna has addressed the Lord as Friend, Yadava etc., and hence is now
feeling remorseful. Arjuna begs Krishna to forgive him just as a father
would forgive a child, a friend would forgive a friend etc.

(11.46)
Comments: Arjuna states that he is overjoyed to have had the
unique opportunity to view the Lord’s Universal Form. But at the same
time, he is frightened looking at the Lord’s threatening form even though
the purpose of that was the destruction of evil forces. Arjuna is also
remorseful about his playful behaviour with Krishna during their times
together. Arjuna now requests Krishna to appear again in His prior form
where He was four shouldered, wearing a crown and holding a mace and a
disc in His hands.

The Lord said: O Arjuna! As I Am pleased with you, I showed you
My amazing Universal form which is full of infinite energy and has no
beginning or end. No one else has seen this form before. (11.47)
O Arjuna, Bravest Among the Kurus! The Universal form that you
were able to see has not been visible to anyone in this world. One cannot
see this even if one has carried out elaborate sacrifices or practiced intense
austerities or made significant charitable donations or undertaken deep
study of the scriptures. (11.48)
Do not be frightened and bewildered by seeing My terrifying
Universal form. Set aside your fears and put your mind at ease as I will
now appear in the form which you have seen before. (11.49)
Comments: The Lord states that Arjuna was able to view His
Universal form because of his devotion and spiritual evolution. Sri Rayaru
in GV cautions that one should not literally interpret verses 11.47 and 11.48
to conclude that no one other than Arjuna has seen the Lord’s Universal
Form. After all, in verses 11.20 and 11.23, it was clearly stated that
everyone in the universe was terrified by looking at the Lord’s Universal
Form. Hence, the proper interpretation of 11.47 and 11.48 is that no one
would have seen the Lord in the same way as Arjuna was able to see Him.
This means that those who are less capable and hence have lesser eligibility
would have experienced the vision of Lord with much lesser precision and
clarity. Also, Sri Madhwacharya in GTN with reference to the Brahmanda
Purana clarifies that superior deities such as Brahma and Rudra would
have viewed the Lord’s Universal Form with much higher precision and

286

The Bhagavad Gita

clarity. Additionally, later in verse 11, 52, the Lord confirms that other
deities also would be viewing the Lord’s Universal Form just like Arjuna.

pacified Arjuna. (11.50)
Comments: Sanjaya relays the next development as an answer to
King Dhrutarashtra’s curiosity. The Lord responding to Arjuna’s request in
verse 11.46, puts him at ease by reappearing in His own human like form
that Arjuna was used to seeing before.

at ease, the Lord reappears in His calm human like form. Arjuna is now
relieved to see Krishna in the form that he was used to seeing.

The Lord Said: Even deities aspire to see My Universal Form that
you were fortunate to see. Looking at My form, some experience happiness
and others feel both happiness and fear. (11.52)
Neither by study of the Vedas, nor by difficult penance nor by
charity and not even by sacrificial rituals can I be seen the way you were
able to see Me. (11.53)
Comments: In 11.52, the Lord states that it is exceedingly difficult
for one to get an opportunity to physically see Him. Even superior deities
are constantly striving to experience a vision of the Lord’s Universal Form.
Among those who can view the Lord, some deities such as Brahma, Rudra
etc., are able to see Him and experience joy. Others feel both joy and fear
by looking at the Lord. Arjuna himself states in 11.45 that he was both
happy and petrified looking at the Lord’s form. In 11.53, the Lord explains
the difficulty in getting an opportunity to view His Universal form, saying
that even study of the Vedas, performing difficult penance, donating to
charity, or performing extensive ritual sacrifices cannot guarantee such an
opportunity.

O Parantapa! Only by single minded devotion can one understand
Me, see Me, and attain My abode. (11.54)
Comments: If one is not guaranteed a vision of the Lord even after
undertaking difficult tasks to please Him as indicated in 11.53, how can one
obtain this vision of the Lord? This verse answers by stating that one needs
to surrender to Him with sincere, unconditional, unparalleled devotion to

288

The Bhagavad Gita

experience a direct vision of the Lord. The Lord uses the adjective
‘ananya’ meaning unparalleled or incomparable to describe the path of
devotion. This implies that one should consider the path of devotion to be
superior to all other paths such as the path of knowledge, the path of action,
donating to charity etc. This also means that these other paths are also
required for one to realize the Lord but are not sufficient in themselves.
They must be accompanied by single pointed devotion.
This verse has been recognized by Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in
BGS as summarizing this entire chapter. Reference to the word ‘drashtum’
(to see) signifies the vision of the Lord’s Universal Form. This verse also
identifies unparalleled devotion as the way to experience divine vision.
Hence, this verse is indeed a summary of this entire chapter.

O Pandava! One who performs all duties only for My sake, who

relinquished worldly pleasures and who has no enmity towards anyone will
indeed reach My abode. (11.55)
Comments: The Lord concludes the sermon in this glorious chapter
by reiterating the qualities of a seeker who will succeed in reaching the
Lord’s abode.
Summary of Chapter 11
After listening to the Lord’s teachings on His divine manifestations,
His amazing activities in terms of creation of the universe etc., in the
previous chapter, Arjuna is naturally curious to physically see the Lord’s
form. The Lord now exhibits His grand, Universal form which is the core
of this chapter termed Vishwa Roopa Darshana (Vision of The Lord’s

Chapter 11

289

Universal Form). The Lord empowers Arjuna with divine vision as one
cannot view Him with ordinary eyes (11.8). Arjuna views the Lord’s
amazing, incredible, Universal Form spanning the entire universe with
countless heads, limbs etc. The descriptions of the Lord’s Universal Form
mirrors that in the Rig Vedic hymn, the Purusha Sookta. Arjuna describes
the grand sight and compares the Lord’s energy to that of thousands of
rising suns (11.12). He can see the entire universe sheltering inside the
Lord including all the deities starting from four faced Brahma (11.15). He
also sees many deities entering the Lord and praying to the Lord with
utmost humility (11.21). Everyone is frightened on seeing the Lord’s
terrifying form. The Lord indicates in 11.32 that He (taking the name of
Kala) is about to perform the act of destroying the evil forces who had
caused the rise of immorality in the world. This was the reason for His
frightening form. The Lord further tells Arjuna that He had already killed
all the leaders of the Kaurava army excepting a few, thereby clearing
Arjuna’s doubts about winning the war. Waging the war is now a formality
for Arjuna (11.33). Arjuna, after seeing the Lord’s form states that while he
feels blessed, he continues to be terrified and threatened by the Lord’s
frightening form. He is also remorseful that he has not treated Krishna with
proper respect as he was not fully aware of His greatness (11.41) and asks
for forgiveness (11.44). Arjuna also requests Krishna to appear again in His
earlier form that he was used to seeing (11.46). The Lord states that it is
exceedingly difficult for anyone to experience a direct vision of His
Universal Form. Even great deities strive extremely hard to experience
such a vision (11.52). Undertaking even difficult tasks such as diligent
study of the Vedas, performing difficult rituals, donating to charity etc.,
will not help one to experience such a direct vision, unless they are
accompanied by unparalleled, pure, unconditional devotion to the Lord
(11.54). The last few verses in this chapter act as a bridge to the next
chapter which focusses on the path of devotion.

Chapter 12 - The Path of Devotion
Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 20 verses is known as Bhakti
Yoga (The Path of Devotion). In chapter 10, the Lord described His special
presence in beings and objects which gave them superiority among peers,
and in chapter 11 the Lord revealed His Universal Form to Arjuna to
convince him of His strength and powers. The Lord also states that it is
exceedingly difficult for one to behold a vision of His Universal Form and
Arjuna was indeed fortunate to have been granted that Divine Vision. In the
concluding verses of chapter 11, the Lord declares that sincere devotion
towards Him is the best way for a seeker to reach Him. This chapter
expands on the concept of devotion and is hence termed the Path of
Devotion. In verse 7.23, it was stated that those who propitiate other deities
will achieve only temporary fruits and not everlasting bliss. However, in
the scriptures it is stated that the Lord’s consort Goddess Mahalakshmi who
is ever liberated is worshipped by all deities from Brahma onwards and that
she grants liberation to the eligible. A natural question that would arise is
about the effects of propitiating Goddess Lakshmi who is also known to
grant moksha to devotees. Arjuna (on behalf of other seekers) seeks
clarification on the benefits of propitiating Goddess Lakshmi who is the
governing deity for the principle of the unmanifest (avyakta). The Lord
responds to Arjuna’s question in verses 12.2 to 12.7 of this chapter and
concludes that worshipping Lord Narayana is an easier way to attain
moksha than pleasing Mahalakshmi. Further, Lakshmi operates under the
Lord Almighty’s control. One should propitiate Sri Lakshmi and other
deities as part of the Lord’s entourage for maximum effect. Bhakti or
devotion is focusing one’s mind on the Lord. The Lord teaches us methods
of worshipping Him through action (karma yoga), through knowledge
(jnana yoga), through meditation (dhyana yoga) and through devotion
(bhakti yoga). The last eight verses in this chapter describe the
characteristics of an ideal devotee who is dear to the Lord.

Arjuna said: Some seekers propitiate the Lord Almighty with
extreme devotion and some others focus on worshipping Goddess
Mahalakshmi (also known as akshara, avyakta), the imperishable,
unmanifest principle of divinity. Among these, which group has a better
understanding of the path to liberation? (12.1)
Comments: In chapter 7, verse 7.23, the Lord clearly stated that
propitiating other deities will only yield temporary fruits and not the
permanent bliss experienced in moksha. In verse 11.55, the Lord indicated
that one should consider Him the supreme entity and surrender to Him with
unconditional devotion to achieve liberation. However, in many instances
in the Vedas, it is clearly stated that Goddess Lakshmi also grants
liberation. Further, she is superior to all other deities such as Brahma and
Rudra and is responsible for the creation of the universe. In verse 7.5, it
was stated that Goddess Lakshmi controls all inert nature. She is superior to
all other deities as she is ever liberated and has an imperishable existence
(indicated by the adjective akshara in this verse). Given these facts, while
some seekers focus exclusively on the Lord Almighty, others focus on
worshipping Goddess Lakshmi. A natural question one would have is about
the best path for the seeker, given that both the Lord (directly) and Goddess
Lakshmi (indirectly) are known to lead one to salvation.

The Bhagavad Gita

The Lord said: In My opinion, those seekers who worship Me with
supreme faith, and conduct their prescribed duties and meditation with the
mind immersed in Me, are superior. (12.2)
Comments: The Lord responds to Arjuna’s question in the following
six verses, 12.2 – 12.7. In this verse, He categorically states that those who
propitiate Him with supreme devotion have a better understanding of the
path to liberation compared to those who focus only on propitiating
Goddess Lakshmi, the imperishable, unmanifest principle. The Lord
provides detailed reasoning for this in the following verses.

The immutable, unmanifest principle does not perish; is beyond
description and pervades everywhere; it is beyond comprehension, has no
limited form like the sky, and is eternal. Those who worship this principle
with control over the senses, with mental equanimity and desiring the
welfare of everyone will also attain Me. (12.3) (12.4)
Comments: Verse 12.3 lists eight superior attributes of Goddess
Lakshmi – imperishable, indefinable, unmanifest, omnipresent,
incomprehensible, immutable, constant, and eternal. As per the scriptures,
propitiating Goddess Lakshmi will also lead one to liberation. These verses
clarify that those who propitiate Goddess Lakshmi who has these superior
attributes will also attain the Lord, but indirectly. Those who propitiate
Goddess Lakshmi must have strict sense control, mental equanimity, and
desire welfare for all.

It takes great effort to propitiate the unmanifest principle properly.
Attaining the final goal of eternal bliss is exceedingly difficult for one
following the path of propitiating only this principle. (12.5)
O Partha! One who surrenders all activities to Me, considering Me as
the Supreme One, worshipping Me with single minded devotion and
focusing the mind on Me will be able to cross the ocean of death bound
samsara, through My grace. (12.6) (12.7)
Comments: The Lord clarifies that achieving liberation by only
propitiating the unmanifest principle is exceedingly difficult. Sri
Madhwacharya in his GB states many reasons for this which are explained
by Sri Rayaru in GV.
 Goddess Lakshmi operates under the control of the Lord as stated in
7.5, 15.17 and hence propitiating only her is an indirect path to
liberation.
 One must observe extremely strict measures in terms of controlling
one’s mind and senses, maintaining mental equanimity etc., as any
dilution in these stipulations will hinder a seeker in obtaining
Goddess Lakshmi’s grace for achieving liberation. These stipulations
are detailed in verses 6.7, 6.8 etc.
 Propitiating the Lord is easier as He pardons devotees who are
unable to adhere strictly to stipulations in worship. The Lord will

294

The Bhagavad Gita

ensure that such devotees will, in due course of time, overcome their
shortcomings (6.40).
 One who propitiates the Lord Almighty with the same effort that
would be spent in propitiating Goddess Lakshmi will achieve
liberation sooner.
Sri Madhwacharya in GB quotes passages from the Sama Veda
(Madhuchhandasa and Ayasya branches) to support these interpretations.
Sri Vidyamanya Teertha in his GPM states that those who only propitiate
Goddess Lakshmi may get distracted by the wealth that they may receive
from her which makes it very hard for such seekers to exert control over
their mind and senses.
In conclusion, worshipping the Lord directly is an easier way to attain
liberation compared to the indirect way of pleasing the Lord through
Goddess Lakshmi. It must be noted that one must worship Goddess
Lakshmi and other deities such as Vayudeva, Rudra etc. also, but with a
conviction that all these deities are part of the Lord’s entourage. It should
also be noted that in the benediction of Gita Vivruti [GV], Sri Rayaru
explicitly states – ‘Lakshmi Narayanam Natva ….’ which translates to – I
offer my obeisance to Goddess Lakshmi and Lord Narayana.

Focus your mind exclusively on Me. If this is not possible, direct
your intellect towards Me (to acquire knowledge about Me). You will be
able to attain My abode in due course. Let there be no doubt about this.
(12.8)
O Dhananjaya! If you are unable to focus your mind on Me
singularly, with an intent on reaching Me as the ultimate goal, perform
repeated practice (abhyāsayogena) to focus your mind on Me. (12.9)
If repeated practice to focus your mind on Me is not possible, then
engage in activities that please Me (such as austerity, worship, service,
charity etc.), for My sake, considering Me as supreme. Thereby you will
eventually attain Me. (12.10)
If it is not possible for one to perform activities such as intense
austerity, worship etc., then one should offer all their actions to Me with no
expectations. (12.11)
Comments: After having established that the best path for a devotee
to attain liberation is by directly propitiating the Lord, a natural question
that would arise is about the best way to do that. In these four verses, the
Lord describes a progressive method for a devotee to worship Him with
singular mental focus. In verse 12.8, the Lord states the superiority of
meditation with mental concentration (dhyana yoga) as previously
described in Chapter 6. If one is not able to achieve this, then one should
try learning about the Lord through scriptural studies (jnana yoga paroksha). If these are not possible, a devotee should practice repeatedly to
achieve these (12.9). If for some reason, one is not able to perform such
practice, then the Lord states in 12.10, that the devotee should at least
engage in physical activities that would please Him (such as worshipping

296

The Bhagavad Gita

Him with flowers, service, charity etc.) as these activities are not taxing on
the mind and intellect. For those who do not have deep conviction in the
Lord, but would rather focus on propitiating other deities, the Lord states in
12.11 that such a devotee should at least perform this propitiation without
expectations and submit the fruits of such action to Him. In verse 7.22, the
Lord states that even those who propitiate other deities will receive their
rewards only through the Lord Himself.
Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in his BGS identifies 12.8 as the core
verse in this chapter. Here the Lord has indicated that the best path for a
devotee to attain liberation is through direct propitiation of Him with
singular mental focus (meditation) on Him. Thus, this verse contains the
core principles of this chapter.

Acquiring proper knowledge is better than repetitions of actions
without proper knowledge. Meditation with firm conviction on the Lord is
better than acquisition of knowledge. Performing prescribed duties while
relinquishing fruits of action is better than mere meditation. Such selfless
duties combined with deep meditation on the Lord are the ways to attain
the Lord’s abode. (12.12)
Comments: The Lord concludes His discussion on the methods for a
devotee to achieve liberation in this verse by summarizing the various steps
involved in attaining moksha, and the relative importance among such
steps. The final destination for every living being is to attain liberation
from bondage, a state where one would experience eternal bliss. The way to
attain moksha is by realizing direct vision and direct knowledge of the Lord
(aparoksha jnana). Such direct knowledge is achievable for one who is
immersed in meditation of the Lord with singular mental focus (dhyana).
Such meditation is possible for someone who has learnt about the Lord
(indirectly through study of scriptures, teachings from a Guru etc. –
paroksha jnana). One must repeatedly practice meditation and scriptural

Chapter 12

297

studies to obtain an understanding of the Lord. One will be able to focus
ones minds on meditation and scriptural studies, if one involves oneself in
activities that please Him (such as worshipping the Lord, service to society,
charity etc.).

One who has no enmity towards any other being, who is friendly to

who has equanimity with regard to victory and defeat in worldly matters,
who forgives others’ mistakes, who is always contented, who is involved in
performing prescribed duties sincerely, who is in meditative contemplation,
who has control over the mind, who has deep conviction in spiritual
principles and who has surrendered mind and intellect to Me is indeed very
dear to Me. (12.13) (12.14)
Comments: In the following verses, the Lord identifies the
characteristics of an ideal devotee who is dear to Him. Many of these
characteristics appeared in previous chapters such as 2.55 – 2.61, 4.22, 5.18
to 5.21, 6.7 to 6.9. The Lord had also stated the nature of a devotee dear to
Him in 7.17. All these characteristics are now consolidated in one place in
the following eight verses 12.13 to 12.20.
In verse 12.13, the Lord describes the characteristics of a compassionate
devotee as one who
 Has no enmity towards anyone
 Anticipates distress and protects friends from it

298

The Bhagavad Gita







Is ever compassionate
Does not claim ownership of any object
Is not under delusion on attributes not present
Treats happiness and sadness with equal disdain

In verse 12.14, the Lord continues to describe the characteristics of a
devotee who has a firm mind and conviction as one who
 Is ever contented
 Performs prescribed duties and intense meditation with spiritual
knowledge
 Has control over the mind
 Has conviction in supremacy of the Lord
 Has mind and intellect focused on the Lord
 Is deeply devoted to the Lord

verses 2.54 onwards.

(12.16)
Comments: The Lord uses the term sarvarambha parityaagi to
describe a devotee who avoids unnecessary activities. Sri Rayaru [GV]
describes the four actions to be avoided by such a devotee. They are –
(i) activities not dear to the Lord, (ii) performing activities with ego,
(iii) performing activities with expectation on the rewards, and (iv) not
submitting all activities to the Lord. Such a devotee is indeed very dear to
the Lord.

One who never gets elated (by worldly riches), who never hates
others, who never complains (on not achieving expected results), who
never desires the prohibited, who always avoids all activities – auspicious
or inauspicious, is indeed dear to Me. (12.17)
Comments: Verse 12.15 identified some characteristics of an ideal
devotee. This verse clarifies that such characteristics should always be
present in a devotee. Sri Rayaru in GV explains the context for the Lord
declaring that His devotees should avoid both auspicious (shubha) and
inauspicious (ashubha) activities. The implication is that one should avoid
even auspicious activities (such as performing rituals for temporary
rewards) if they end up in entangling a devotee. One should only aspire for
divine knowledge, detachment (towards worldly matters) and devotion to
the Lord.

Comments: These characteristics were highlighted previously in 6.7,
6.8, 6.9 etc., when describing an ideal dhyana yogi (one who is immersed
in concentrated meditation of the Lord). The qualities of friendship in a
friend or enmity in a foe are not inherent in friends and foes but are due to
the Lord who endows one with these qualities based on one’s innate nature.

The methods indicated here are the ways to worship the Lord
Almighty and achieve liberation. The Lord states that one who observes
these methods sincerely, with deep faith and devotion in Him, is indeed
very dear to Him. (12.20)
Comments: Any devotee who has any of these characteristics
described in verses 12.13 to 12.19 is dear to the Lord. Hence, a devotee
who has all these identified characteristics is indeed extremely dear to the
Lord and will easily reach Him.
Summary of Chapter 12
In chapter 10, the Lord described His divine presence in beings and
objects which give them superiority among their peers, and in chapter 11,
the Lord revealed His Universal Form to Arjuna to convince him of His
strength and powers. The Lord also stated that it is exceedingly difficult for
one to achieve the vision of His Universal Form and that Arjuna was

Chapter 12

301

indeed fortunate to have been granted that Divine Vision. In the concluding
verses of chapter 11, the Lord declares that sincere devotion towards Him
is the best way for a seeker to reach Him. This chapter expands on the
concept of devotion and is hence termed the Path of Devotion.
In verse 7.23, it was stated that those who propitiate other deities will
achieve only temporary fruits and not everlasting bliss. However, in the
scriptures it is stated that the Lord’s consort, Goddess Mahalakshmi who is
ever liberated is worshipped by all deities from Brahma onwards and she
grants liberation to the eligible. A natural question that would arise is about
the effects of propitiating Goddess Lakshmi who is also known to grant
moksha to devotees. Arjuna (on behalf of other seekers) seeks clarification
on the benefits of propitiating Goddess Lakshmi who is the governing deity
for the principle of the unmanifest (avyakta). The Lord responds to
Arjuna’s question in verses 12.2 to 12.7 of this chapter and concludes that
worshipping Lord Almighty Narayana is an easier way to attain moksha
and pleasing Mahalakshmi is difficult. Further, Lakshmi operates under the
Lord’s control. One should propitiate Goddess Lakshmi and other deities as
part of the Lord’s entourage for maximum benefit.
Bhakti or devotion is focusing one’s mind on the Lord. In verses
12.8 – 12.12, The Lord teaches Arjuna the methods of expressing devotion
using facilities such as intellect, studying, performing prescribed duties etc.
The last eight verses in this chapter describe the characteristics of an ideal
devotee who is dear to the Lord. Many of these characteristics were stated
in previous chapters and are consolidated here in a unified manner for easy
reference.

Chapter 13 - The Field and The Knower of the Field
Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 35 verses is termed Kshetra
Kshetrajna Yoga (The Field and the Knower of the Field). As indicated in
the introductory chapter, Sri Rayaru in GV has provided an excellent
categorization of the 18 chapters in Gita by dividing them into 3 groups of
6 chapters each. Chapters 7-12 dealt primarily with the topic of the Lord’s
attributes and greatness as seen in Chapter 10 (The Lord’s Divine
Manifestations), Chapter 11 (The Lord’s Universal Form) etc. After all, the
goal of every living being is to realize the Lord to achieve liberation.
Chapters 1-6 discussed the various means for one to realize the Lord, such
as the path of knowledge, the path of action, the path of devotion etc. These
last six chapters (Chapter 13 to 18) expand on some of the important
concepts covered in the previous chapters. In chapter 2, verses 2-12
onwards, the attributes of individual souls were described. In chapters 10,
11, 12 etc., the Lord’s forms, attributes and greatness were discussed. In
verse 7.4, the attributes of eightfold inert nature were discussed. Arjuna
now wants to understand more about the interrelationships between the
three entities – the Lord Almighty, individual souls, and inert nature. The
Lord responds to Arjuna’s questions on the entities in verses 13.2 to 13.24.
The interrelationships between these three entities form the philosophical
basis for the principle of fivefold differences (pancha bheda).

Arjuna said: O Keshava! I would like to know more about – inert
nature, the individual, the field of activity, the knower of the field of
activity, knowledge, and the object of knowledge. (13.1)

Chapter 13

303

Comments: Arjuna requests details on the following six topics –
prakruti (inert nature) and purusha (individual soul), kshetra (field of
activity) and kshetrajna (one who fully knows about kshetra), jnana
(knowledge and prerequisites to obtain knowledge) and jneya (the one who
is to be known). In verses 13.2 to 13.7, the Lord provides details on kshetra
and kshetrajna and verses 13.8 to 13.19 cover the topics of jnana and jneya.
Verses 13.20 to 13.24 are related to prakruti and purusha. The remaining
verses describe the interaction and interrelationships among these entities.
The word purusha can refer to both the individual soul (jeevatma)
and the Lord Almighty (paramatma) based on the context of its use, as seen
from verses 13.22 where it refers to the individual soul and 13.23, where it
refers to the Lord. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that the word purusha in this
verse refers to the individual soul. Also, the word jnana which ordinarily
refers to knowledge should be taken to mean the method to obtain
knowledge. This will be evident from the Lord’s response in verses 13.8 to
13.12, where the Lord identifies 20 different characteristics needed to
obtain knowledge.

The Lord said: O Son of Kunti! This body made of inert nature is
the field of activity. One who has a good understanding of the constituents
of this field of activity is the knower. (13.2)
Comments: The Lord uses the word shareera (physical body) to
identify the entity that forms kshetra (the field of activity), based of word
derivation. Here, shareera = shar (the entity subject to feelings) + eera (the
entity owing its existence to the Lord). The knower of the field of activity
is termed kshetrajna, the one who knows kshetra which is derived from
ksheeyate (the entity with indwelling Lord Almighty).

O Bharata! In all fields of activity, I am the knower. Preeminent
knowledge is knowing both kshetra (field of activity) and kshetrajna
(knower of this field of activity). (13.3)
Comments: Since the physical body (kshetra) belongs to a living
being, can that living being be called kshetrajna (knower of the field of
activity)? No. The Lord clarifies by emphatically stating that He is the
knower of the field of activity. Further, Vishnu Sahasra Nama, verse 2
identifies kshetrajna as one of the names of the Lord. Also, by using the
qualifier sarva (all) before the term kshetra, it is clarified that the universe
of inert nature also comes under the definition of field of activity.

Comments: The Lord now resolves to provide details of the field of
activity in terms of its composition, transformation, governing entities,
influencing entities etc. The fact that the field of activity is under the
control of other entities, confirms its dependent nature.

Great sages have sung praises about the nature of the field of
activity. The Vedas also describe them separately. The Brahma Sutras
have given definitive rulings on this topic. (13.5)
Comments: The Lord states that the concepts described in His
teachings have been well known, based on proclamations from various
sages and descriptions in scriptures such as the Vedas, Brahma Sutras etc.
In that sense, these are authentic and recorded teachings.

The field of activity is comprised of the following - the five basic
elements of nature (earth, water, fire, space, air), principles of
individuation, consciousness, intellect and the three qualities of nature
which comprise the unmanifest. Along with these, there are eleven sense
organs (five organs of perception, five organs of action and mind), five
objects of the sense organs (form, smell, sound, taste, touch), emotions of
desire, disdain, pleasure, pain, the physical body, mental propensity, and
determination (all these entities have governing deities). (13.6) (13.7)
Comments: The Lord describes the composition of the field of
activity. It contains both physically observable elements such as the five
basic elements of nature, inner faculties, and qualities/attributes. All these
make up a personality. The unmanifest entity is comprised of the three
qualities of nature, namely, sattv (pious), rajas (passion), and tamas
(ignorance). The principle of intellect is one of the four inner faculties,
which are mind (manas), intellect (buddhi), individuation (ahankara), and
memory (chitta). The mind causes confusion, and the intellect helps in
discrimination.

306

The Bhagavad Gita

In verse 13.34, the Lord had also indicated that He would describe
the entities that govern the components of the field of activity. They are
governed by deities who cause the entities to act. The deities who control
the components of the field of activity are described by Sri Rayaru in GV
as follows (i) The five basic elements of nature: space (Ganapathy), air
(Mareechi), fire (Vahni), water (Varuna), and earth (Dhara Devi)
(ii) The four cosmic principles: avyakta - unmanifest (Lakshmi),
mahat – cosmic intelligence (Brahma), ahankara - individuation (Rudra),
buddhi - intellect (Parvati)
(iii) The mind (Skanda, Indra, Aniruddha – son of Kama)
(iv) 5 sense organs of perception): ear (Moon), skin (Marut), eyes
(Sun), tongue (Varuna), nose (Ashwini twins)
(v) 5 sense organs of action: voice (Agni), hands (Maruts), Feet
(Yagna, Shambhu), excretory organs (Yama), organs of reproduction
(Shiva, Manu)
(vi) 5 objects of sense organs: sound, touch, form, taste, smell
(five children of Shiva)
The above 25 principles result in the effects of emotions indicated in
13.7. The governing entities for these effects are: Desire (Sreedevi and
Bharatidevi), disdain (Kali), sadness (Dwapara), happiness (Mukhya
Vayu), determination and boldness (Saraswati, Bharati), mental propensity
(Sreedevi), physical Body (other deities)
The relative gradations of these governing deities were alluded to in
verse 3.42. All these deities operate under the control of the Lord as
indicated previously in verse 3.43.
A note on the principles of mahat and buddhi: Many times, the term
buddhi is used to refer to both mahat and buddhi. However, mahat and
buddhi are different principles with mahat referring to cosmic intelligence

Chapter 13

307

and buddhi referring to normal intelligence. In that sense, mahat, whose
governing deity is Brahma, is responsible for special, divine knowledge
(vijnana - aparoksha), and buddhi whose governing deity is Parvati is
responsible for acquired knowledge (jnana - paroksha). The concepts of
jnana and vijnana were covered in Chapter 7. Also, many principles have
multiple governing deities, with one primary governing deity and one or
more secondary deities. In all cases, the Lord is the controlling deity.

The prerequisite attributes for one to achieve true knowledge are as
follows - humility, modesty, non-violence, tolerance, sincerity, servitude
towards teachers, internal and external cleanliness, steadfastness,
detachment from sense pleasures, absence of ego, awareness of birth, death,
old age and diseases, non-attachment to possessions, equipoise during gain
and pain, deep single-minded devotion in Me (Krishna), keeping aloof,
staying away from crowds, always thinking about the Lord. All these

308

The Bhagavad Gita

attributes comprise knowledge and are the means to achieve knowledge.
Anything contrary to these constitutes ignorance. (13.8) (13.9) (13.10)
(13.11) (13.12)
Comments: From verse 13.3 onwards, the Lord provides details about
the entity (the Lord ) that stimulates and powers the components of the
field of activity. To understand the attributes and nature of that entity, it is
important for a seeker to have requisite mental and physical discipline.
These are represented by the 20 attributes of an enlightened person
identified in these 5 verses and they form the path or procedure or ways
(sadhana) for one to understand the Lord. An ideal seeker is one who:
1. is humble
2. is unpretentious
3. practices non-violence
4. is tolerant
5. is sincere in action (physical, vocal, mental)
6. respects and serves teachers and scholars
7. has internal and external cleanliness
8. has conviction in righteousness
9. has self-control
10. renounces sensual desires
11. is devoid of ego
12. is always aware of the distressful conditions of birth, death, old age,
and disease
13. is detached from worldly possessions
14. is not excessively attached to family and possessions
15. is equanimous in the face of pleasure and pain
16. is exclusively devoted to the Lord
17. prefers to be in solitude
18. stays away from crowds indulging in useless activities (not dear to
the Lord)
19. is constantly involved in learning about the Lord
20. is immersed in contemplation of scriptures for realizing the Lord

Now I will describe that principle which is to be known (the object
of knowledge), knowing which one will attain the nectar of immortality.
That object is the Supreme Lord who has no beginning and is eternal. This
principle is distinct from entities that have form (sat) and those that are
formless (asat). (13.13)
Comments: Lord Krishna clarifies that He is the object of
knowledge and hence is termed jneya (the one to be known). The Lord
identifies Himself as jneya but uses the qualifier anadi matparam (the one
who has no beginning and who is Supreme) as in verse 8.3. Of course, in
verse 7.7 etc., He already declared that there is no one superior to Him, and
hence there is no need to repeat that attribute. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies
that the Lord is distinct from entities that have form and those that are
formless. The entities that have form are the three basic elements of nature
(earth, water, fire) and those that are formless are the two remaining basic
elements of nature (air, space). This is a way of indicating that the Lord is
above and beyond the influence of nature.

Comments: If the Lord is different both from entities with form and
those without form, how is He to be visualized? This verse answers by
stating that the Lord indeed spans everywhere with all organs, however,

310

The Bhagavad Gita

these organs are transcendental (aprakruta) and not prakruta (composed of
material nature). The Lord had made His Universal form visible to Arjuna
and other eligible souls as was described in Chapter 11.

It (the object of knowledge) activates all sense organs and objects of
sense perception. It does not have any sense organs. It is not impacted by
anything and consumes everything. It is devoid of attributes and is full of
attributes (13.15)
Comments: The Lord continues His description of the object of
knowledge. While 13.14 dealt with the Lord’s form, this verse is about the
Lord’s attributes and seems to imply antithetical qualities. Sri Rayaru in
GV provides rationalization for these seemingly contradictory descriptions.
The Lord not having sense organs is referring to Him not having sense
organs made of material nature as His organs are transcendental in nature.
Similarly, while He consumes the positive essence of all activities, He is
not bound by actions. And He is devoid of attributes as He is beyond the
three attributes of nature (sat, rajas, tamas). He is full of infinite,
auspicious attributes.

(13.16)
Comments: The Lord is present in all living beings and exists
outside of them, pervading the entire universe. He is termed stationary in
the sense that He does not experience transformation in His attributes.

Comments: The Lord is present in all beings in an undivided form
(avibhaktam) but appears to have different (vibhaktam) forms. The use of
the term ‘eva’ in this verse refers to the Lord appearing to have different
forms. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that learned ones know the Lord as
having undivided form, with multiple incarnations of the same form with
no difference. Ignorant ones consider these as different.

It is the light of even bright objects (such as the Sun), beyond

(13.18)
Comments: The object of knowledge (The Lord Almighty) is a selfilluminating divine light that powers all luminous objects in the universe
such as the Sun, and as stated in the Vedas, it is beyond ignorance, death,
and material nature. It is the embodiment of all knowledge and knows Itself
fully. How can one reach such an entity? This verse answers by stating
jnanagamyam (the Lord is reachable through spiritual, divine knowledge).
In verse 13.16, it was stated that the Lord exists both inside and outside of
living beings. In this verse, it is clarified that the Lord resides inside every
living being within the heart (hrudi). Sri Rayaru in GV quotes the Brahma

312

The Bhagavad Gita

Sutras (1.2.7) to explain the Lord’s existence in a minute form as well as
an immeasurable one spanning the entire universe with a comparison to the
sky which occupies all spaces.

I have thus described in brief, the field of activity, knowledge, and
the object of knowledge. My devotees who properly understand these
principles will reach My abode. (13.19)
Comments: The Lord concludes His sermon on the topics that
Arjuna had identified in verse 13.1, namely, kshetra (field of activity) and
kshetrajna (one who fully knows about kshetra), but does not explicitly
indicate kshetrajna here, as it is included in jneya. Verses 13.2 to 13.7,
covered the details of kshetra and kshetrajna and verses 13.8 to 13.19
covered the topics of jnana and jneya. The word jnana is used to mean both
knowledge and the prerequisites for knowledge and these were covered in
verses 13-8 to 13-11, and verse 13.12 respectively. The Lord also states
that His devotees who properly understand and live by these principles will
reach Him. It must be noted that mere scholarship on these topics is not
enough for one to reach the Lord. They must be incorporated in a seeker’s
life. Such a person is indeed a true devotee of the Lord.

Know that nature and being are both eternal. Their transformations

Comments: In the next five verses 13.20 – 13.24, the Lord answers
Arjuna’s question from verse 13.1 regarding prakruti (nature) and purusha

Chapter 13

313

(being). Prakruti can mean both insentient nature and sentient nature.
Likewise, purusha can mean both the individual soul and the Supreme Soul
(Lord Almighty). The appropriate interpretation depends on the context in
which these words are used. Verse 13.6 describes prakruti (nature), and
verse 13.7 describes its transformations. These constitute the physical body
and personality of purusha (the living being – individual soul). Both nature
and individual souls have no beginning and have always existed.

Creation of an individual’s physical body and sense organs is
performed by sentient nature (Goddess Mahalakshmi), and the experience
of emotions by an individual is due to the Lord. (13.21)
Comments: This verse describes the interaction between the
individual soul, nature (inert and sentient) and the Lord. Again, as stated in
the comments on the previous verse, prakruti can mean both inert nature
and sentient nature and, purusha can mean both individual soul and the
supreme soul (Lord Almighty). Accordingly, Sri Rayaru in GV provides
two interesting interpretations.
While the Lord Almighty is primarily responsible for the creation of
living beings and for the experience of their emotions, Goddess Lakshmi
also has a role to play. She has a higher role in creation as compared to
consumption or experiencing happiness or sadness by living beings. Hence,
she is indicated as the cause for the creation of living beings.
Alternately, this verse can also be interpreted to mean as follows.
Inert nature is the material cause in the physical creation of living beings,
and living beings consume or experience emotions such as happiness and
sadness.

It is well known that the individual soul residing in the body,
comprised of the elements of nature, experiences emotions through contact
with the three attributes of nature. It is then reborn in pious or unholy
families depending on the level of attachment with such emotions. (13.22)
Comments: The use of the letter ‘hi’ in the first line indicates that
the impacts of the elements of nature on the emotions experienced by a
living being are known through experience. An individual experiences
emotion such as happiness or sadness due to the impact of the attributes of
nature such as sattv, rajas and tamas. Excessive attachment to such
emotions will entangle an individual. For example, individuals who
experience happiness may focus exclusively on accumulating worldly
riches to ensure everlasting happiness, which prevents them from
performing activities that please the Lord. Their actions impact the
circumstances of their succeeding births.

The Lord resides in all individuals and is a witness to their activities.
He activates and propels every action based on a soul’s innate abilities. He
consumes the fruits of all activities, and He is omnipotent. (13.23)
Comments: Verse 13.4 raises many questions on the field of
activity, the knower etc. One of the questions was about the entity who
governs the field of activity. The Lord answers this question by stating that
He is the entity that governs all activities in all beings, and He is also the
consumer of all these activities. The previous verse 13.22 indicated that
interactions with the effects of the qualities of nature determine the future
birth of an individual. This verse clarifies that the qualities of nature are
material causes and the instrumental cause is the Lord. As stated in

Chapter 13

315

comments to verse 13.20, the word purusha can refer to either a living
being, or the Lord Almighty and the appropriate interpretation depends on
the context. In this verse, purusha refers to the Lord due to the use of the
adjective para (supreme).

One who understands that the individual souls and the Supreme One
are different, who understands nature (sentient and insentient) and acts
accordingly, will not be reborn regardless of one’s state and condition
during one’s lifetime. (13.24)
Comments: Verses 13.20 to 13.23 described the interaction between
purusha (living being) and prakriti (sentient and insentient nature).
Together with previous verses which described the interaction of these
entities with the Lord, one can understand the relationship among these
three entities. The Lord states that one who has a proper understanding of
these concepts will achieve liberation even if one has strayed onto wrong
paths in one’s lifetime. Many times, even the learned ones due to force of
circumstances (such as a curse) might stray away from the right path. Such
beings will in due course of time, through the Lord’s grace, get back to the
right path and move towards liberation.

Some visualize the Lord residing in their bodies through their

(13.25)

316

The Bhagavad Gita

Those who cannot visualize the Lord through the above means,
worship the Lord by learning about Him from scholars. Even those, who
rely only on acquiring knowledge about the Lord through listening to
scriptures, will cross this ocean of worldly affliction. (13.26)
Comments: Since one needs to experience a direct vision of the
Lord to attain divine, spiritual knowledge, this verse identifies the different
paths taken by seekers in their spiritual journey. Some visualize the Lord
through concentrated meditation (dhyana). Some visualize the Lord
through intense study, contemplation, and analysis of scriptures (jnana).
Some visualize the Lord through performance of prescribed duties without
expectations (karma).
Sri Rayaru in GV quotes Sri Madhwacharya’s GTN for a second
interpretation of this verse. Some sages visualize the Lord in their hearts
through meditation and through their innate talent (pratibha) of novel
interpretations of scriptures. Deities, through their innate talent of
discovering newer interpretations of scriptures, can visualize the Lord
without a need for vocal instruction from their superiors. Some who are
superior among rulers perform their prescribed duties such as protecting
their citizens during attack from enemies and performance of sacrifices
(such as Ashwamedha). They visualize the Lord who appears before them
to consume their offerings during such sacrifices.
Verse 13.26 addresses the situation of those who are not as talented
as the deities indicated in 13.25. Such seekers also benefit greatly from
learning about the Lord through vocal instructions from their teachers and
can ultimately cross the ocean of worldly miseries. This indicates the power
of shravana or vocal instruction. Deities starting from Brahma have
gradations in not only their physical form but also in their innate talent. For
example, Lord Brahma and Lord Vayudeva are endowed with 32 superior
qualities in their physical form. Other deities have lesser superior qualities
in their physical forms. Likewise, Lord Brahma and Vayu have the highest

Chapter 13

317

innate talent (pratibha) among all living beings and can visualize and
meditate on the Lord without any explicit vocal instruction. But it is
observed that even these great deities are often listening to Vedic teachings
from the Lord. They do this as a respect to the Lord to earn His grace and
to develop even deeper conviction in their understanding of Him.

O Superior among the Bharatas! Know that all entities in the
universe, movable and immovable, are created out of the union of sentient
nature and the Lord Almighty. (13.27)
Comments: The Lord continues to answer the question posed in
13.27 regarding the field of activity, its origins, its transformations etc. This
verse describes the process of creation of living beings. The union of
kshetrajna (the Lord Almighty) and kshetra (the sentient nature embodied
by Goddess Lakshmi) results in the creation of all entities in the universe.
The word kshetra which was previously interpreted to mean the physical
body of living beings can also be interpreted to mean Goddess Lakshmi. It
should be noted that in a later verse 14.3, the Lord explicitly indicates that
He and His consort are responsible for the creation of all living beings.

The Bhagavad Gita

The same Lord Almighty resides in all beings. Even when these
living beings perish, the Lord continues existence as He is imperishable.
The one who knows this is indeed knowledgeable. (13.28)
One who knows the Lord as being defectless, full of infinite
auspicious attributes, and residing in equal measure in all, will never lose
knowledge and will never experience downfall. Such a person will be on
the right path (13.29)
Comments: In verse 13.3, the Lord indicates that He resides in all
beings as kshetrajna. However, living beings experience different emotions
such as happiness and sadness in varying proportions. These verses explain
that regardless of the differing experiences in different living beings, the
Lord exists uniformly in everyone. Sri Rayaru in GV quotes the Brahma
Sutra (3.2.11) which states that the Lord who exists in different places and
in different beings has no difference among His forms.

All activities of living beings are performed by the Lord Almighty
Himself using the elements of nature, based on their innate abilities. One
who is aware of this dependency on the Lord is truly knowledgeable.
(13.30)
Comments: This verse clarifies that the difference in birth situations
experienced by living beings is primarily due to their differing innate
natures (and resulting activities) and not due to any partiality on the part of
the Lord. Sri Rayaru in GV quotes the Brahma Sutra (2.1.35) to support
the argument that the Lord does not exhibit partiality towards anyone.
This verse also describes the doership of activities performed by
living beings. Rayaru in GV provides two interpretations for this verse
based on the phrase ‘atmanam akartaram’. It was stated previously in

Chapter 13

319

comments on verse 6.5, that the word ‘atma’ has many meanings and the
two meanings applicable here are – individual soul and Supreme Soul
(Lord Almighty). With these two meanings, the phrase ‘atmanam
akartaram’ can be interpreted as follows - Ones who are considered truly
knowledgeable are aware that (i) the Lord who activates the individual beings to perform their
activities is Himself not activated by anyone else (akartaram)
(ii) living beings cannot perform any activities independently
(akartaram)
This important verse is identified by Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in
his BGS as comprising the core concepts in this chapter.

One who realizes that multitudes of different living beings exist

Comments: The Lord not only activates all living beings, He is also
the supporter of multitudes of living beings and in that sense, they are said
to exist inside Him. Sri Rayaru explains in GV that the use of the qualifier
‘pritak’ (different) when describing various living organisms (bhootanam),
refers to the varying nature of individual souls (jiva-jiva bheda) which is
one of the essential features of the pancha bheda (the fivefold differences)
principle. This will be explained at the end of this chapter.

The Bhagavad Gita

He is imperishable. Hence the Lord, even though existing inside an
individual will not be impacted by the defects of that individual. The
activities of individuals do not taint the Lord. (13.32)
Summary: The previous verse alluded to the differences amongst
individual souls and between individual souls and the Lord. This verse
purports to answer many questions that may arise from superficial
interpretations in scriptures that seem to indicate identity among individual
souls and the Lord. Sri Rayaru in GV quotes Sri Madhwacharya’s GTN and
advances five arguments to illustrate the difference between individual
souls and the Lord.
1. This verse uses the word ‘shareerastha’ to refer to individual souls
who have physical bodies comprised of the elements of nature and
are subject to birth. The Lord is referred to as ‘anadi’ (birthless).
This concept was described in 10.3.
2. Individual souls are influenced by the three qualities of nature (guna)
as indicated in verses 13.20 to 13.22. The Lord is referred to as
‘nirguna’ (the one beyond the three qualities of nature). This concept
is discussed in 7.13 and 14.19.
3. This verse uses the word ‘shareerastha’ to refer to individual souls
who have physical bodies comprised of the elements of nature and
hence are subject to decay and death. The Lord is referred to as
‘avyaya’ (imperishable). This concept was discussed previously in
2.17.
4. The Lord independently causes the activities of individual souls who
by themselves cannot perform any activity. The Lord’s activities are
not with any expectations as indicated by the phrase ‘na karoti’. The
Lord has no obligation to perform any activities. This concept was
indicated in 3.22.
5. Even though the Lord is the cause of activities in everyone, He
Himself is not tainted by the actions of individual souls as indicated

Chapter 13

321

by the phrase ‘na lipyate’. This was also indicated in verses 4.14, 9.9
and 13.30.

Just as space that pervades everywhere and touches everything is not
tainted by anything, the Lord likewise is pervading everywhere and in
everyone, but is never tainted. (13.33)
Comments: This verse provides an example to illustrate the concept
of the Lord not getting tainted by anyone’s activities which was addressed
in the previous verse. Space exists everywhere, in the minutest of objects
and outside in the entire universe. However, it does not take on the
attributes of those objects. Likewise, the Lord who resides in every being is
not impacted by the attributes and activities of these beings. A similar
example was employed previously in verse 9.6.

O Bharata! Just as a single Sun illuminates this entire world, the
Lord who is omniscient illuminates the entire universe. (13.34)
Comments: This verse uses the example of the Sun to demonstrate
the Lord’s infinite energy and radiance. There is only one Sun that
illuminates our entire world, and likewise there is only one Lord Almighty
who illuminates, powers, and activates the entire universe and its
inhabitants.

The Bhagavad Gita

One who can, through the eyes of knowledge, clearly understand the
difference between the field of activity, the knower of the field of activity
and the method to achieve liberation from nature’s bondage, will surely
attain the Lord’s abode. (13.35)
Comments: The Lord concludes His teachings in this chapter by
summarizing that one, who by following the methods in 13.8 to 13.12 can
attain proper knowledge about the field of activity and the knower of
activity, and the differences between them will indeed attain the Lord
whose special attributes and differences from individual souls and inert
objects were identified in various verses such as 13.32 to 13.34. This verse
uses the term antaram (difference) to indicate the difference between
kshetra (living beings and nature) and the kshetrajna (the Lord Almighty).
The relationship between the three entities in the universe, namely
individual souls, inert nature, and the Lord Almighty described in this
chapter can be viewed as an explanation for the concept of fivefold
differences (pancha bheda), which is one of the foundational principles of
the philosophy of Sri Madhwacharya. The fivefold differences among – (i)
inert objects, (ii) among individual souls, (iii) between individual souls and
inert objects, (iv) between the Lord and individual souls, and (v) between
the Lord and inert objects. Verses 13.6 and 13.7 enumerated the different
components of nature that impact an individual’s personality. These
indicated the differences among the inert components of nature. Verse
13.22 indicates that individual souls experience different types of births
based on their interaction with the qualities of nature, and verse 13.31
refers to different living beings and hence they describe the difference that
exists between individual souls. Verses 13.20 and 13.21 describe the
impact of inert nature on living beings, highlighting the difference between
individual souls and inert objects. Verse 13.19 indicates the difference
between inert nature and the Lord Almighty and verse 13.34 clarifies the
difference between the individual soul and the Lord Almighty.

Summary of Chapter 13
As indicated in the introductory chapter, Sri Rayaru in GV has
provided an excellent categorization of the 18 chapters of Gita by dividing
them into 3 groups of 6 chapters each. The last six chapters (13 – 18)
provide details on some of the important concepts covered in the previous
chapters. In chapter 2, verses 2-12 onwards, the attributes of individual
souls were described. In chapters 10, 11, 12 etc., the Lord’s forms,
attributes and greatness were discussed. In verse 7.4, the attributes of
eightfold inert nature were discussed. Arjuna now wants to understand
more about the interrelationships among the three entities – the Lord,
individual souls, and inert nature. This chapter provides clarification on this
topic and forms the philosophical basis for the principle of fivefold
differences. In verse 13.1, Arjuna requests details on the following six
topics – prakruti (inert nature) and purusha (individual soul), kshetra (field
of activity) and kshetrajna (one who fully knows about kshetra), jnana
(procedure to obtain knowledge) and jneya (the one who is to be known).
In verses 13.2 to 13.7, the Lord provides details on kshetra and kshetrajna
and verses 13.8 to 13.19 cover the topics of jnana and jneya. Verses 13.20
to 13.24 are related to prakruti and purusha. The remaining verses describe
the interaction and interrelationships between these entities. The
relationship among the three entities in the universe, namely the individual
souls, inert nature that the Lord described in this chapter can be viewed as
an explanation for the concept of fivefold differences (pancha bheda)
which is one of the foundational principles of the philosophy of Sri
Madhwacharya.

Chapter 14 - Division of Qualities
Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 27 verses is termed
Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga (Division of Qualities). This chapter has details
on the three qualities of nature (sattv – pious, rajas – passion, tamas –
ignorance) which define ones personality. These concepts were introduced
in chapter 3 (3.5) and are expanded here. The creation of the universe
through sentient Mother Nature is described. The ways in which the three
qualities bind a person are also explained. The method to escape from the
clutches of the three qualities are described. The previous chapter had a
discussion on the interactions between inert nature, the individual soul, and
the Lord. Verse 13.22 indicates the impact of the three qualities of nature
on living beings. Activities of living beings are influenced by the three
qualities of nature and such activities entangle them. This chapter provides
details on the three qualities of nature in terms of their origin, influence,
impact and more importantly, the method to overcome them.

The Lord said: O Arjuna! There is one more important principle
which I will teach you now. Great sages have attained liberation by
understanding this concept. (14.1)
One who realizes this knowledge will attain My abode and will not
be reborn during the next cycle of creation. Also, they will not suffer
during the next cycle of dissolution. (14.2)

Chapter 14

325

Comments: For one to get freed from bondage and achieve
liberation, it is important to understand the ways that one gets influenced
by the three qualities of nature. The Lord had resolved to impart such
knowledge to Arjuna in verse 2.39 and expanded on the concepts
introduced in verse 3.5. In verse 14.1, the Lord states that seekers who
understood this concept previously had attained liberation, and hence it is a
proven path. In verse 14.2, the Lord states the rewards for those who attain
this knowledge during their spiritual journey. Such seekers will attain
moksha, which is identified as the state where one does not suffer from
worldly miseries that impact living beings who are subject to repeated
births and deaths. In that sense, the state of moksha is identified as
‘sadharmya’ (in an extremely limited sense, somewhat like the state of the
Lord who is never subject to any miseries).

O Bharata! Mother Nature (Goddess Mahalakshmi) is My consort, in
whose womb I place the embryo, from which the process of creation of all
beings starts. (14.3)
O Son of Kunti! For all living beings born in various species, Mother
Nature is the mother, and I am the father planting the seeds. (14.4)
Comments: In these two verses, the Lord describes the process of
creation of living beings which is due to the interaction of the Lord with
His consort, Goddess Mahalakshmi who is the governing deity of nature.
This aspect was briefly described previously in verse 13.27. Inert nature
and its components were previously identified in verse 7.4. Sri Rayaru in

326

The Bhagavad Gita

[GV] clarifies that the interaction described in this verse applies to every
cycle of creation of the universe. Further, this applies to all categories of
living beings such as deities (angels), humans, and demons.

O Arjuna, Mighty Armed One! The three attributes, namely virtue
(sattva), passion (rajas) and ignorance (tamas) are born out of insentient
nature. These attributes tightly bind individual souls which intrinsically do
not perish (the governing deities for these three attributes are Sridevi,
Bhoodevi and Durgadevi which are forms of Goddess Mahalakshmi).
(14.5)
Comments: After describing the interaction between the Lord
Almighty and His consort, Goddess Mahalakshmi in the previous verse,
this verse outlines the process by which the three qualities of nature bind an
individual soul. Goddess Mahalakshmi, in her three forms of Sri, Bhoo, and
Durga governs the three qualities, namely virtue (sattva), passion (rajas)
and ignorance (tamas), respectively. In general, all living creatures are
entangled by these three qualities. Specifically, Goddess Sridevi binds
deities (angels), Goddess Bhoodevi binds humans, and Goddess Durgadevi
binds demons. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that souls who are in moksha
after liberation are not entangled by these qualities. The binding applies
only to beings who are not yet liberated. This is implied using the word
dehina (those with physical bodies). Liberated souls do not have physical
bodies.

O Anagha (Arjuna, One without sins)! The quality of sattva is pure
and hence is ideal for acquiring spiritual knowledge. It removes defects and
diseases. It helps connect one with pure knowledge and bliss. (14.6)
O Son of Kunti! The quality of rajas creates obsession and
attachment. It causes the feelings of desire and expectations with respect to
pursuing objects of sense pleasure. It binds one with passion (sensory
pursuits). (14.7)
O Bharata! The quality of tamas is responsible for covering one with
ignorance. It can create delusion in everyone. It is responsible for
forgetfulness, lethargy, and excessive sleep. (14.8)
Comments: These three verses describe the impact of the
entanglement of the three qualities (sattva, rajas, tamas) on deities,
humans, and demons, respectively. It must be noted that even deities who
are destined for liberation will be bound by the quality of sattv till they
achieve divine, spiritual knowledge and attain liberation through the grace
of the Lord.

The quality of sattva leads one to joyful activities. Rajas leads one to

O Bharata! When the proportion of sattva in an individual exceeds
that of rajas and tamas, it then dominates over the other two. Similarly,
rajas and tamas will dominate when they are in higher proportion. (14.10)
Comments: After entangling living beings as described in previous
verses, the three qualities influence their character and hence their
activities. While the three qualities themselves are inert entities, it is their
respective governing deities which are responsible for influencing living
beings. How do these three qualities influence one who is entangled by all
three of them? Verse 14.10 states the three qualities typically will not be
present in equal proportions, and the one which is in higher proportion will
have the predominant influence.

dominant sattvic activities are drawn towards spiritual studies and acquire
divine knowledge. Those with dominant rajasic qualities have their mind

Those with sattvic qualities eventually reach the higher, divine

types of awareness and knowledge which cause them to indulge in differing
activities. These actions eventually lead them to three different
destinations.

Comments: In verse 3.5, it was stated that living beings perform
activities based on the influence of the qualities of nature. In this chapter,
the origin, influence, and impact of the three qualities of nature on living
beings were described in detail. This verse clarifies that these qualities
themselves are not supreme, and that the Lord is their controller. The Lord
is beyond these three qualities, and they act under His control and
supervision. This verse also clarifies the difference (bheda) between the
Lord Almighty and inert nature represented by the three qualities.

One who can reach beyond the three qualities created by nature will
be able to overcome birth, death, old age, and misery, and achieve
liberation. (14.20)
Comments: After having described the influence and impact of the
three qualities of nature, the Lord says that one should strive to avoid
getting entangled by them. This will help one achieve liberation.
The quality of sattv (piety) is pure and influences one to pursue
spiritual studies which enables one to traverse on the right path. Why then
should one try to reach beyond even the quality of sattv? Sri Vidyamanya
Teertha in GPM clarifies that some who attain spiritual knowledge can
develop arrogance and pride due to their achievements. One should avoid
getting trapped in arrogance and pride.

Comments: After listening to the Lord’s sermon on the origin,
influence, and impact of the three qualities of nature on living beings and
the need for one to reach beyond these qualities (verse 14.20), Arjuna is
naturally curious to learn about the abilities and attributes of such seekers.
Arjuna had previously asked a similar question about the abilities of those
with mental equanimity (stita prajna) in 2.54.

The Lord said: O Son of Pandu! One who has transcended the three

and delusion when they occur, nor craves for them when they cease, OR,
On worldly issues, such people do not despise knowledge (due to sattva),
activity (due to rajas) or ignorance (due to tamas). But on the issue of the
Lord’s attributes, they crave for knowledge (due to sattv) and activity (due
to rajas) and abhor delusion (due to tamas). (14.22)

of those who overcome the influence of the three qualities in the following
four verses 14.22 to 14.25. Many of the abilities and attributes stated here
have been previously described in verses 2.55 to 2.59, 5.18 to 5.20, 6.7 to
6.9, 12.13 to 12.30, 13.8 to 13.12 etc., while enumerating the characteristics
of seekers who are on the right spiritual path. The abilities and attributes
described in these verses must be viewed in the context of one’s
relationship with the three qualities of nature. Sri Rayaru in GV provides
the inner meanings of these verses based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GB and
GTN.
The three qualities of nature exist in two modes – gross and subtle.
The gross aspect of the three qualities of sattv, rajas and tamas leads one to
indulge in the respective pursuits of spiritual knowledge, sensory pleasure
and harmful lethargy. The subtle aspects of these three qualities result in
one displaying keen interest (due to sattv), some interest (due to rajas), and
disdain (due to tamas) respectively in learning about the Lord’s auspicious
attributes. One who has conquered the three qualities of nature does not
treat with contempt the outcomes of activities related to worldly matters.
However, with regard to learning about the Lord’s attributes, such a person

334

The Bhagavad Gita

desires the impact of subtle aspects of sattv and rajas and abhors the impact
of tamas.
Sri Rayaru in GV provides another meaning for this verse: One who
has conquered the three qualities of nature does not envy those who have
attained divine, spiritual knowledge due to sattv and does not wish for the
return of lost ignorant knowledge.

They appear to be detached towards most activities even while
indulging in prescribed activities undertaken only to please The Lord. They
are convinced that natural qualities act as per the wishes of the Lord and
cannot act independently. They do not indulge in useless pursuits. (14.23)
They treat worldly happiness and distress with equanimity. They
look at a piece of gold and a lump of mud the same way. The pleasant and
the unpleasant, and praise and insult, are the same to them. (14.24)
For such people honour and dishonour, friends, and foes, are the
same. They do not indulge in any worthless activities and focus only on
those activities that please the Lord. They are the ones who have crossed
the three qualities. (14.25)
Comments: After having described the attributes of those who have
crossed the three qualities of nature, the Lord describes their attitudes in

Chapter 14

335

performance of activities that please the Lord. They appear dispassionate
and indifferent in performing any activity, but they are quietly performing
activities that please Lord Vishnu. (The word udaseenavat mean ‘appear
indifferent’ due to the use of the qualifier vat). They will not stop
vaishnavic activities even if they ever come under the influence of the three
qualities, as they are aware that these qualities do not act independently but
are under the control of the Lord.
Likewise, they do not stop propitiating the Lord if they do not see
any worldly gains. Similarly, they do not stop engaging in activities dear to
the Lord even if some in society consider those activities as unnecessary or
undesirable. They are also not impacted by the views of their friends or
foes in matters related to propitiating the Lord. In other words, they are
steadfast in their devotion to the Lord.

One who worships Me with pure, unalloyed devotion will indeed be
able to reach beyond the three qualities and attain the abode of Mother
Nature - Goddess Mahalakshmi (which is also My abode). (14.26)
Comments: The previous verses describe the characteristics of one
who can reach beyond the three qualities of nature. How can a seeker attain
such superior characteristics? The Lord states that unalloyed devotion to
Him is the surest way for one to reach this state. Such a seeker will be freed
from the bondage imposed by sentient nature and will reach the abode of
Goddess Mahalakshmi who is the governing deity of nature. As Goddess
Mahalakshmi entangles one with the three qualities of nature, one must first
please her to get liberated from bondage. As indicated previously (verse
12.6), one must always propitiate Goddess Lakshmi together with her
consort, the Lord Almighty.

Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in his BGS has identified this verse as a
summary of this entire chapter. This verse makes a reference to the three
qualities of nature which bind a living being, and states that pure devotion
to the Lord is the way to overcome such entanglement. Hence, it is indeed
apt to consider this verse as a summary of this entire chapter.

I am the refuge for eternal sentient nature (Goddess Mahalakshmi)
and for liberated souls. It is well known (from scriptures) that I am the
abode for eternal righteousness (dharma) and pure bliss (moksha). (14.27)
Comments: The previous verse states that a devotee who has
crossed the three qualities of nature, will reach the abode of Goddess
Mahalakshmi, which is also the abode of the Lord. A seeker who is on the
spiritual path will first reach the abode of Goddess Lakshmi and with Her
grace will be liberated in the abode of Lord Almighty. This is the state
where the liberated souls will experience unending, uncorrupted bliss.
Summary of Chapter 14
As indicated in the introductory section, the third set of chapters
(from Chapter 13 to 18), provide more details on specific concepts
discussed in the earlier sets of chapters. The previous chapter had a
discussion on the interaction between inert nature, the individual soul, and
the Lord, and indicated the impact of the three qualities of nature, namely
sattv (piety), rajas (passion), and tamas (ignorance) on living beings.
Activities of living beings are influenced by the three qualities of nature
and such activities entangle them. For one to get freed from bondage and
achieve liberation, it is important to understand the way that one gets
influenced by the three qualities of nature. This chapter provides details on
the three qualities of nature in terms of their origin (verses 14.3-14.4),

Chapter 14

337

entanglement (verses 14.5 –14.8), impact and result (verses 14.11-14.18).
Verse 14.19 clarifies that the Lord Almighty controls the three qualities of
nature and is beyond their reach. The Lord also states in 14.21 that a seeker
should strive to traverse beyond these three qualities to achieve liberation.
In verses 14.22 to 14.27, the Lord enumerates the traits of those who escape
entanglement by these three qualities and eventually reach His abode.

Chapter 15 – Theology of The Supreme Being
Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 20 verses is known as
Purushottama Yoga (Theology of The Supreme Being). This chapter is
principally concerned with the establishment of the principle of the Lord
Almighty’s supremacy and hence is termed Purushottama Yoga where
uttama means Supreme and purusha means Being. This chapter is
considered by many to have the core teachings of the entire Gita. The Gita
has 700 verses spread over 18 chapters. Chapter 15 which has 20 verses,
interestingly has 700 letters (15 verses have 32 letters each and the
remaining 5 verses have 44 letters each)! This gives credence to the
argument of this chapter’s importance based on numerology. While the
Lord had previously described the components of the universe such as
living beings, inert objects, and the Lord, in this chapter, He illustrates the
interrelations among them using the example of a banyan tree. The Lord
had indicated His presence in living beings previously, especially within
their hearts in verses 9.4, 10.20, and 13.18. This chapter provides more
details on the aspects of His presence in living beings. Further, in the
previous chapter 13.24, it was stated that a seeker who understands the
relationship between the Lord (purusha) and nature will eventually achieve
liberation. This chapter provides more details on the attributes of the Lord
(purusha). In verse 15, the Lord explicitly states His presence in everyone
and declares that He is the primary subject matter of the Vedas. In verses
16 to 20, the Lord emphatically describes Himself as the Supreme Being,
different from all other beings, thereby convincingly establishing the
philosophy of dualism (dvaita) which was popularized by Sri
Madhwacharya and other seers in his lineage such as Sri Jaya Teertha and
Sri Raghavendra Teertha.

The Lord said: The eternal banyan tree of the Universe is
characterized by the following - The Lord is like the earth that supports the
tree, Mother nature is the root of the tree. The 8 principles of nature are the
branches of the tree. The tree is eternally transforming like a running
stream. The Vedas are the leaves of this tree. One who knows these, knows
the Vedas.
Comments: This enigmatic verse describes the universe using the
example of a banyan tree. One must carefully analyze each word to
understand the inner meanings in this verse. Sri Rayaru in his GV based on
Sri Madhwacharya’s GB and GTN provides an excellent interpretation for
this verse using the word derivation approach of Sanskrit.
Firstly, the word ‘oordhwa’ is derived from ‘uttamatvaat’ and means
‘one that is superior’. Further, in the Vedas, Lord Vishnu is described as
‘oordhwa’, hence it refers to Lord Almighty Vishnu. Thus, Lord Vishnu is
the foundational component for the tree and hence represents the earth that
supports the tree. Sentient nature and its three qualities are governed by the
Lord’s consort Mahalakshmi who is superior to all other entities in the
universe and hence represents the three roots of this Tree of the Universe.
The word ‘adha’ means inferior and represents the 8 principles of nature
(the 5 elements of physical nature and the principles of mahat consciousness, ahankara - individuation, and buddhi - intellect). These 8
principles and their governing deities are like the branches of this Tree of
the Universe. The tree is termed ashwattha (continuously transforming) and
avyaya (eternal). The word ‘ashwattha’ can be derived in two ways.
(i) a + shwa + ttha, where shwa means ‘tomorrow’ a + shwa means ‘not

340

The Bhagavad Gita

tomorrow’. Hence this word means that the state of the tree tomorrow is not
the same as it is today, which implies that the Universe is continuously
transforming. This is compared to a stream of running water, where water
is eternally running as a stream, but the content of water at any place at any
time is not the same as it is in a previous instant. (ii) ashwattha is derived
from the word ‘ashwa’ which means ‘horse’. A horse is constantly in
motion and does not stay still. Similarly, the universe is continuously in
motion. It should also be noted that previously in chapter 10 (10.26), the
Lord had stated that among all trees, He has a special presence in
‘ashwattha’ (the banyan tree). The Vedas are like leaves of this tree. Just as
the leaves bloom and give rise to flowers and fruits, seekers who learn the
Vedas will earn the fruits such as worldly riches and ultimately, moksha
(the Lord’s abode).

The branches of this Tree of the Universe are nourished by the three
qualities of nature and extend both above and below. The sprouts represent
the objects of sensory perception. The roots represent the Lord, sentient
nature, and inert nature. Nature along with its three qualities of sattv, rajas,
and tamas entangles living beings. Just like the roots of a tree are
responsible for the fruits grown, the rewards based on actions in this world
are due to the Lord, sentient nature and the three qualities represented by
the roots. (15.2)
Comments: This verse continues the description of the Tree of the
Universe and is even more enigmatic than the previous verse. In the
previous chapter (14.5), it was stated that Goddess Mahalakshmi in her
three forms of Sri, Bhoo, and Durga controls the ‘gunas’, the three qualities
of nature (sattv, rajas, tamas). This verse states that the five basic elements
of nature and the three principles represented by the branches of this tree

Chapter 15

341

are influenced by the three qualities of nature (gunas). Hence, the roots
which represent sentient and inert nature are superior to the branches which
represent the elements of nature and the three principles (mahat, ahankara,
buddhi). The three qualities of nature (sattv, rajas, tamas) are like new
roots. The three principles and the five basic elements of nature present in a
living being are responsible for the objects of sensory perception which are
pursued by living beings. This was described previously in verses
14.11 – 14.13. These objects of sensory pursuits are represented by the
sprouts which emanate from the branches of the tree. The sprouts have
temporary existence just like the experience of sensory pleasures by living
beings.
Sri Rayaru in GV states that the above interpretation of the
components of the Tree of the Universe is based on the description in the
Bhallava branch of the Vedas which states that the Lord who supports the
Tree of the Universe is not part of the tree but is distinct from it. The
components of the banyan tree (and their governing deities) in these two
verses can now be summarized as follows:
Earth (supporting the tree) = The Lord Almighty
Roots = Sentient and inert nature
New roots = The three qualities of nature
Branches = The five basic elements of nature, and the three
principles
Sub-branches = Physical bodies of living beings
Leaves = The Vedas
Flowers, Fruit = Worldly desires, Liberation
These two verses appear to illustrate the concepts of gradations
among various deities described previously in 3.42 with the help of a
Banyan tree.

This tree is constantly evolving (like a flowing stream) and does not
stagnate; hence cannot be seen. It has neither beginning nor end. One
should chop this tree with the sharp weapon of firm detachment (as the tree
has very strong roots), to separate the hidden roots from other parts of the
tree (one should use the strong weapon of devotion and detachment to
understand the distinction between the Lord, Nature and the individual
souls). (15.3)
Comments: After having described the structure of the Tree of the
Universe in previous verses, this verse states the action that a seeker needs
to take to progress on the spiritual path. The tree is constantly evolving as
new sprouts, leaves, flowers, and fruits bloom and the old ones wither.
However, the earth and the strong roots do not wither. Similarly, the
entities in the universe such as living beings and inert objects are constantly
changing but the Lord and Mother Nature who are represented by the
strong, foundational roots of this tree, are not subject to any change and do
not perish. This verse clarifies that the Lord who pervades all and is
invisible during the beginning and end of the universe (during the time
epoch kalpa) continues to be invisible during its lifetime. These concepts
were previously stated in 9.7 and 9.10. To completely understand the
Lord’s greatness, a seeker must chop this tree with a strong, sharp weapon
to be able to separate the tree from its foundation and understand its roots.
That sharp weapon is described as asanga = a + sanga. This word can be
interpreted in two ways – (i) asanga = detachment (as sanga means
attachment) which implies that one should detach oneself from worldly
matters, and (ii) asanga = involvement in activities pleasing to the Lord, as
the letter a represents the Lord. This concept is clarified by Sri
Prabhanjanacharya in GM.

Then one should learn more about the Lord through spiritual studies.

Comments: In the previous verse it was stated that a seeker should
chop the Tree of the Universe with the weapon of detachment and
knowledge. This verse describes the procedure to chop the tree. A seeker
should learn about the Lord through the process of studies, contemplation,
and analysis of scriptures to develop conviction in divine knowledge. Only
when one is aware of the distinction between the Lord and other entities in
the universe, will one be able to develop firm conviction in divine
knowledge. One should surrender to the Lord to escape from the cycle of
births and deaths. Only then will one eventually attain the Lord’s abode
never to return to this world.

world that we live in is illuminated by the Sun (during daytime), the Moon
(during nighttime), and by fire. The Lord’s abode is vastly different. The
Lord is self-illuminating, and He does not need any external entities to
illuminate His abode.

The eternal individual soul inside the physical body of beings is like
an infinitesimal fraction of Me (similar in being eternal but distinctly
separate in attributes and capabilities). The individual soul directs the six
sense organs (including the mind) towards objects of pleasure, propelled by
the qualities of nature. (15.7)
Comments: It was stated previously (verse 5.14) that living beings
cannot act on their own and their activities are propelled and stimulated by
the Lord. This verse states that an infinitesimal fraction of the Lord is
present inside the physical bodies of individual souls. This concept was
described earlier in verses 9.4, 10.20, 13.18 etc. This fraction of the Lord is

Chapter 15

345

like the individual soul as both are eternal in nature, but this fraction of the
Lord is vastly different and superior to all individual souls. This concept is
described later in verses 15.16 – 15.20. Sri Rayaru in GV based on Sri
Madhwacharya’s GB states that a fraction or amsha of the Lord is of two
types – (i) bhinna amsha (fraction that is different) and (ii) swaroopa
amsha (intrinsic fraction, as in the case of the Lord’s various incarnations).
The fraction of the Lord present in living beings is like the individual soul
in the sense that a firefly is like the Sun, as both are illuminating objects but
are vastly different in attributes and capabilities.

At the time a soul enters a body and at the time it leaves, the Lord
carries the sense organs (in a subtle form) into and out of the body, just like
a gentle, blowing wind carries the fragrance of flowers. (15.8)
Comments: Does an individual soul by itself direct attention
towards objects of sense pleasure? This verse is a continuation of the
previous verse and states that it is the Lord Almighty resident in living
beings who causes pursuit of sense pleasures. The Lord is always present in
living beings. When a soul leaves the physical body, the Lord causes the
sense organs of perception to travel along with the soul. Sense organs here
refer to their subtle form and not the gross organs that one can see in a
physical body. The process of the subtle sense organs carried along with a
departing soul out of a physical body is compared to a gently blowing wind
that carries the fragrance of a flower. No one can see the fragrance being
carried by the wind, but one can smell the fragrance. The flower does not
lose its fragrance even though the wind carried a part of it. In the Brahma
Sutra (3-1- 4), it is stated that when a soul leaves the body and the body is
consumed by the elements of nature (such as fire), the sense organs also get
consumed. How can this be reconciled with the statement that the Lord
carries the sense organs along with the soul? Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies by
stating that the Lord carries the subtle sense organs (a fraction of the

346

The Bhagavad Gita

physical sense organs) as per this verse and the Brahma Sutra is referring
to the gross sense organs.

The Lord resides in the sense organs: ears, eyes, skin, tongue, nose,

(15.9)
Comments: It was stated previously in 9.4, 10.20, 13.18 etc., that the
Lord resides within the hearts of living beings, stimulating all their
activities. In 11.33, the Lord declares to Arjuna that He has already killed
Arjuna’s enemies and that Arjuna is only an instrument, thereby confirming
that it is the Lord who performs all activities. Further, it was stated in 9.24
that the Lord is the consumer of the fruits of all activities. While earlier
verses in this chapter such as 15.1, 15.2 described the structure of the Tree
of the Universe, in this verse the Lord who is resident in every living being
declares that He is the consumer of the objects of sense pursuits. It is
clarified in the next verse that the Lord consumes only the
righteous/healthy fruits of activities.
This verse is identified by Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in his BGS as
representing the core concepts of this chapter. This verse establishes the
relationship between the Lord Almighty, the individual souls, and inert
objects (sense organs of all living beings). It also establishes the supremacy
of the Lord (Purushottama Yoga), His doership of activities and
consumption of righteous fruits of such activities, thereby establishing the
independence of the Lord, and the dependency of individual souls and inert
objects. While the sense organs of perception are identified here, they are
governed by deities whose order of gradation was identified previously in
3.42. Given the breadth of principles covered in this verse, it is apt to
recognize this as the core verse for this chapter.

from indulgence in objects of sense pursuits. Since the Lord is the ultimate
consumer of fruits of sense pursuits, does He also experience happiness and
sadness? This verse states that the Lord only consumes the
righteous/healthy fruits from objects of sense perception as clarified in the
use of the qualifier ‘guṇānvitam’.

Comments: The next four verses describe the Lord’s presence in
specific entities. The Sun provides light and energy to the entire world.
However, the Sun is only one among millions of stars and all of them are
powered by the Lord. Sri Rayaru in GV quotes the Brahma Sutra (1.3.22)
and Katha Upanishad (2.5.15) which state that the light and energy in the
Sun and the Moon are due to the Lord. It is interesting to note the example
of 3 objects, namely, the Sun, the Moon, and fire in this verse. The Sun as a
star is an intrinsic source of light and energy. The Moon does not emanate
light on its own but reflects the light of the Sun. Fire in materials such as
wood and charcoal are not visible, but when one lights them, they emanate
energy. So, these three types cover objects whose light and energy are seen
and objects whose light and energy are unseen.

Comments: As stated in verse 15.9, the Lord resides in, and powers
the activities of all living beings. This verse describes the process of
digesting food powered by the Lord Almighty. Living beings consume four

Chapter 15

349

types of food: food that is masticated and then swallowed, food that is
swallowed directly, food that is licked, and food in liquid form that is
drunk. Every food article that one consumes belongs to one of these
categories. The Lord, in the name of Vaishwanara resides in living beings
in the form of jatara agni (abdominal fire). Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that
the deity Mukhya Prana in the forms of prana and apana, powered by the
Lord, helps in the process of food consumption and digestion which
includes distribution of energy in food to various parts of the body.

of the Vedas. I am the author of Vedanta. I am the only one who knows all
the Vedas. (15.15)
Comments: This is one of the most important verses in the Gita as it
summarizes many of the key teachings related to the attributes and
greatness of the Lord. In this verse, the Lord emphatically declares that He
is resident in all living beings (within their hearts) and causes them to attain
knowledge and lose knowledge. The Vedas are scriptural texts that are
vocally passed on from one generation to the next. They are not authored
by anyone, human or divine. Various passages in the Vedas superficially
appear to propitiate deities such as Agni (fire), Varuna (water) etc. The
Lord clarifies here that the Vedas primarily describe Him alone (and
describe other deities secondarily). The Lord does not state that He is the
author of the Vedas, but states that He is the author of Vedanta. Sri Rayaru
in GV clarifies that Vedanta means vedanaamanto nirnayo (the definitive
summary of the Vedas), in other words, the Brahma Sutras. This is

350

The Bhagavad Gita

consistent with the historical fact that the Brahma Sutras were composed
by Lord Vedavyasa, who is another form of the Lord. Sri Rayaru in GV
also quotes the Bhagavata (11.21.42), where Lord Krishna teaches
Uddhava that He alone knows the Vedas fully.

There are two types of dependent souls in the Universe, kshara and
akshara. Those individual souls with perishable bodies are known as
kshara and Goddess Mahalakshmi, the ever liberated and the one without a
perishable body is akshara. (15.16)
Comments: After having described the Lord’s omnipresence,
omniscience, infinite strength etc., in previous verses, the next 5 verses
categorically describe the supremacy of the Lord. This verse identifies two
types of dependent individual souls. Living beings are described as kshara
as they have perishable physical bodies. Even liberated souls have had
perishable bodies previously. The one without a perishable body (akshara)
is termed kootastha which means space (which is eternal). This was stated
previously in 2.17. The only dependent, sentient entity in the universe
which is eternal and has no perishable body is the Lord’s consort
Mahalakshmi. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that the masculine form akshara
to describe Goddess Mahalakshmi is an acceptable usage based on
Lakshmi’s strength that exceeds that of male deities. This is as per Sri
Madhwacharya’s commentary on the Chandogya Upanishat (3.15).

There is another entity different from and superior to both the kshara
and the akshara. That eternal, imperishable entity which pervades all three
worlds and supports and nourishes them is known as Paramatma
(The Supreme Among Beings). (15.17)

Chapter 15

351

Comments: After having described the two dependent, sentient
entities in the universe, namely kshara and akshara, the Lord declares that
there is another entity which is distinct from and superior to both. Sri
Vadiraja Teertha in his BGL states that the word ‘tu’ which precedes the
word ‘anya’ (different) indicates that this other entity is quite different
from the other two. This entity pervades all three worlds and provides
support and nourishment. Even though the three worlds suffer destruction
(at the time of the Great Dissolution), the supreme entity continues its
existence as indicated with the words ‘avyaya’ and ‘īśvaraḥ’. Hence it is
logical to describe this supreme entity as Paramatma (the supreme among
all souls). Sri Rayaru in GV quotes the Shweta Upanishat (6.13) to
support the concepts in this verse.

I (Krishna), am superior to ksharas (individual souls) and to even
akshara (Goddess Mahalakshmi) and hence am known as Purushottama
(The Supreme One) of all the worlds and am described as such in the
scriptures. (15.18)
Comments: Is the Supreme Soul described in previous verse
different from Krishna? The Lord answers by confirming that He indeed is
the Supreme Soul. This fact is supported by ‘loka’, scriptures that are
composed, and the ‘Vedas’ which are revealed.
The use of the word ‘api’ in akṣarād api (meaning - even akshara)
when referring to the Lord’s supremacy over Goddess Mahalakshmi
(akshara) is interesting. While one can generally understand the Lord’s
superiority over all individual souls, this verse states that He is superior to
even Goddess Lakshmidevi (who is worshipped as the Mother of this
Universe). This is to further emphasize the principle of the Supreme Being.

O Bharata! One who considers Me as ‘The Supreme One’ without

Comments: How does a seeker act after learning about the principle
of the Supreme Soul? Such a seeker will not fall under the wrong
impression that the distinction between the Lord and individual souls is
only transactional (vyavaharika) and not spiritual (paramarthika) (as per
Sri Vadiraja Teertha’s BGL). Based on the evidence in the scriptures, such
a seeker would develop deep conviction in the concept of duality
(difference among supreme soul and the individual souls) and would
propitiate the Lord through all the means (vocal, mental, physical).

O Anagha (Arjuna, the one without sins)! I have taught you the most
confidential spiritual principles. O Bharata! One who knows this is deemed
to have acquired the ultimate spiritual knowledge (aparoksha jnana) and
will be liberated. (15.20)
Comments: This chapter started with a couple of enigmatic verses
describing the structure of the Tree of the Universe and ended with a clear,
unambiguous characterization of the principle of duality. One who clearly
understands these confidential principles will attain direct, divine
(aparoksha) knowledge and will achieve eternal bliss.
These last 5 verses 15.16 – 15.20 unambiguously establish the
relationship between the Lord Almighty, individual souls, and the inert
universe with the clear conclusion that the Lord Almighty is supreme
among and different from all individual souls and inert objects. The term

Chapter 15

353

Purushottama (the supreme personality) is described in these verses and
forms the basis for the title of this wonderful chapter - ‘Purushottama
Yoga’. Sri Madhwacharya quotes these 5 verses extensively in his works
such as Vishnu Tattva Vinirnaya, Mayavada Khandana, Sadachara
Smriti in addition to his two commentaries on the Gita.
Summary of Chapter 15
This chapter of 20 verses and 700 letters is considered by many to be
the most important chapter in the entire Gita, and the one that summarizes
all its 700 verses. This chapter is principally concerned with the
establishment of the principle of the Lord Almighty’s superiority and hence
is termed Purushottama Yoga where uttama means supreme and purusha
means the Being. The relationship between the inert universe, individual
souls and the Lord Almighty were previously discussed. In this chapter,
these fivefold differences are explained with the example of a banyan tree.
Verses 15.1 and 15.2 describe the structure of the tree. This description is
enigmatic, and one can appreciate the explanation provided by Sri Rayaru
in GV to help understand the real meaning of these verses. The
correspondence between the components of the tree and the entities in the
universe are as follows: Earth (supporting the tree) = The Lord Almighty;
Roots = Sentient and inert nature; New roots = The three qualities of
nature; Branches = The five basic elements of nature; Sub-branches =
Physical bodies of living beings; Leaves = The Vedas; Flowers,
Fruit = Worldly desires, Liberation. Using the analogy of a banyan tree,
these two verses appear to illustrate the concepts of gradations among
various deities described previously in 3.42. Verses 15.3 – 15.5 describe
the manner in which a seeker needs to approach the concepts in the Tree of
the Universe to understand the nature of the Lord. Verses 15.6 to 15.14
describe some specific attributes of the Lord such as omnipresence and
omniscience. Verse 15.15 is one of the most famous verses in the Gita in
which the Lord emphatically declares His presence in the hearts of all
living beings and states that He is knowable through the Vedas. Verses
15.16 to 15.20 establish the relationship between the Lord Almighty,

354

The Bhagavad Gita

individual souls, and the inert universe with the clear conclusion that the
Lord Almighty is supreme among and different from all individual souls
and inert objects. These verses are distinguished by their clarity and
simplicity, which is different from the enigmatic nature of the initial few
verses. The term Purushottama (the supreme personality) is described in
these verses and forms the basis for the title of this wonderful
chapter - ‘Purushottama Yoga’.

Chapter 16 – The Divine and the Demoniac
Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 24 verses is known as
Daivasura Sampat Vibhaga Yoga (Division of the Divine and the
Demoniac). This chapter delves deep into types of human nature. In the
previous chapters, there were many references to pious, virtuous people
with divine nature and to people with demoniac nature. This chapter
provides more details on human traits. These traits are intrinsic to an
individual. One cannot judge people based on the external appearance,
position in society etc. In the previous chapter, verse 15.5 described the
methods to achieve divine, spiritual knowledge and liberation. Verse 15.11
described those who can achieve self-realization and those who cannot.
These are the characteristics of divine and demoniac natures, respectively.
Some of these characteristics were described in verses 9.11 to 9.14 also.
This chapter provides more details on the divine and demoniac
characteristics which help a seeker to inculcate divine attributes and avoid
association with demoniac ones. Hence this chapter is a logical extension to
the previous chapter.

The Bhagavad Gita

The Lord Said: Fearlessness, purity in mind, conviction in the path of
divine knowledge, charitable nature, self-restraint, involvement in
sacrificial activities, pursuance of Vedic study, austerity, uprightness.
(16.1)
Non-violent, truthful, devoid of anger, benevolent, faithful (to the
Lord Almighty), averse to fault finding, compassionate, devoid of avarice,
gentle, modest, determined (to do good deeds). (16.2)
Valour, patience, fortitude, purity (physical and mental), absence of
malice and ego. O Bharata! These attributes are observed in those with
divine nature. (16.3)
Comments: The Lord identifies 26 divine characteristics in these 3
verses. Fearlessness refers to one who is not only fearless, but also does not
cause fear in others. This was indicated earlier in 12.15 as the characteristic
of one who is dear to the Lord. Sri Rayaru in GV states that one who is
desirous of liberation must inculcate these characteristics.

are detailed in verses 16.7 to 16.18.

O Son of Pandu! Divine nature paves the way for levels of liberation
while demoniac nature pushes one to downfall. Do not despair. You

Comments: After identifying the 26 characteristics of those with
divine nature, the Lord comforts Arjuna stating that he does not need to
despair as he is of divine nature. Arjuna is an incarnation of the deity Indra
and has innate angelic characteristics.
Sri Rayaru in GV draws attention to the use of the word vimokṣā
while referring to liberation. vimokṣā is derived as vividha + mokṣā,
meaning different levels of bliss in liberation based on the innate abilities
(yogyata) and efforts (sadhana) of souls.
Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in his BGS has identified this verse as
representing the core concepts in chapter 16. Given that this chapter is
about divine and demoniac character and the fact that this verse identifies
the ultimate destination of the divine and the demoniac, it is apt to consider
this as the core verse. In addition, in this verse the Lord also reiterates the
divine nature of Arjuna.

Comments: There are multifaceted personalities in this world.
Previously in chapter 9 (verses 9.11 – 9.14), characteristics of different
types of people were described. So, how can there be only two
characteristics – divine and demoniac? Sri Rayaru states in GV that the
discussion in this chapter concerns those with significantly higher
proportions of divine and demoniac characteristics.

Those with demoniac natures do not have knowledge about
performing prescribed activities and about avoiding prohibited activities.
They are impure in mind and body. They do not have good conduct and are
not truthful. (16.7)
Comments: Verse 16.4 identified few major characteristics of
demoniac nature. The following 12 verses (16.7 to 16.18) have a detailed
description of demoniac nature and resultant conduct.
The Lord uses the word ‘na’ thrice in the second line to indicate the
absence of each of the three characteristics (namely purity, right conduct,
and truthfulness) in demoniac nature instead of grouping them together. Sri
Rayaru in GV explains that the reason for individually indicating their
absence is to convey the extent of complete absence of each of these three
attributes.

They say that the world is unreal and is not dependent on the Lord

universe. They do not believe in the orderly creation of the universe, which
they say is a result of lustful co-existence. (16.8)

Chapter 16

359

Comments: Sri Rayaru in GV provides two interpretations for the first
line of this verse:
1. The words satya, pratishta, and īśvara all refer to the Lord Almighty
who is responsible for the creation and the dissolution, the
sustenance, and the regulation of the universe (respectively signified
by these three names). Those with demoniac natures do not believe
in the supreme entity with the above attributes (signified by the
prefix ‘a’ for the above three terms).
2. Those with demoniac natures believe that the universe is unreal, has
no creator, and has no controller.
It must be noted that their nonbelief in the orderly creation of the
entities in the universe is inconsistent with the cyclic order of creation
described by the Lord in verse 3.14.
Author’s Note: The idea that the world is real has been widely discussed
in Hindu philosophical circles [OPM]. One school of thought holds the
position that the world is neither real not unreal. It's proponents use an oft
quoted example of a seashell and a piece of silver to make the point. Our
Acharyas have pointed out the sheer futility of the argument which is based
on totally convoluted and irrational thinking. That the world is real is a
position seminal to the philosophy of Sri Madhwacharya, and The
Bhagavad Gita itself supports this in its every verse.

Ignorant people with such viewpoints corrupt their minds
themselves; they indulge in risky activities and are born to cause
destruction of societies. (16.9)
Addicted to insatiable desire, covered with vanity and conceit, they
justify their actions based on misinterpretations of scriptures and indulge in
pursuit of temporary, worldly pleasures. (16.10)
Such people, immersed in dangerous activities, endlessly pursue
gratification of the senses which they consider to be the goal of life. They
are convinced that there is no life beyond this world. (16.11)
Imprisoned by multitudes of unfulfilled desires, overcome by lust
and anger, they indulge in illegal and unethical means to earn wealth,
primarily for physical pleasures. (16.12)
Comments: These four verses describe the actions of those with
demoniac natures and the excuses they provide to justify their actions. They
do not just act out of impulse, but rather use the basis of misinterpreted
scriptures to justify their actions. Verse 16.12 identifies the passions of
kama (lust) and krodha (anger) as the root cause for immoral activities.
This was also indicated previously in verse 3.37.

Those with demoniac natures proclaim as follows: I earned this
wealth. I will satisfy all my desires. I will continue to gather more wealth. I
will destroy my current opponents and emerging ones. I am the Lord. I
have achieved everything. I am strong. I am born in a rich and famous
family. There is no one equal to me. I will perform ritual sacrifices. I will
donate to charity. I will enjoy myself. Such is their extreme arrogance and
ignorance. (16.13) (16.14) (16.15)
Comments: These three verses describe the attitudes of those with
demoniac natures. These have been identified previously by the Lord as the
attributes that a seeker should avoid. The Lord had proclaimed in many
verses ((5.14), (5.15), (15.9)) that no one can act on their own and all
actions are due to Him. Yet, those with demoniac nature claim ownership
of their successes and achievements. In verse 2.18, the Lord clarified that
no one could kill someone else (as the soul is indestructible and even the
destruction of the physical body is only due to the Lord alone). Yet those
with demoniac natures claim that they alone destroy their opponents. In
6.41, it was stated that one’s future births are based on one’s past sincere
efforts. Yet, those with demoniac natures boast about their family and
lineage. They also make inconsistent claims. While they claim that they are
indeed the Lord Himself, they also claim that they perform ritual sacrifices.
If they are the Lord themselves, who do they propitiate in their ritual
sacrifices? Their ritual and outwardly religious activities are a sham show
to project a favourable image of themselves to society.

rituals without proper procedures in order to show off. (16.17)
They exhibit ego, arrogance, selfishness, lust, and short temper. They
insult Me (Krishna), who is resident in them and in all others, purely out of
jealousy. (16.18)
Comments: These verses continue the description of demoniac
nature. In verse 16.17, it is stated that they are complacent about
themselves. This trait is seen in some, who, under the garb of charity
donate money for some cause and expect publicity for societal acceptance
and recognition. They claim that they perform activities independently and
challenge the Lord to make them perform specific activities that they are
not interested in.

harbour hatred towards the Lord and consider that their only purpose of life
is physical enjoyment at any cost.

Lust, anger, and greed are the three gates to hell and self-destruction.
One should get rid of these three harmful characteristics. (16.21)
Comments: In this verse the Lord identifies the main human
passions that propel one towards harmful activities leading to
self-destruction. These are lust, anger, and greed. Lust is the never-ending
desire for physical gratification. Previously in verse 3.37, the Lord stated
the negative impacts of kama (lust) and krodha (anger). In verse 1.38,

364

The Bhagavad Gita

Arjuna himself had stated that the Kauravas were blinded by their greed
(lobha) for a share of a kingdom which did not belong to them. This greed
eventually destroyed the Kauravas. Anger occurs when one is not able to
fulfil ones desires. Greed is the emotion that causes one to accumulate
excess wealth at any cost for fulfilling unending desires. These three
emotions are identified as the doors to hell as they stimulate destructive
behaviour leading to unrecoverable downfall.

One who acts contravening the conduct prescribed in the scriptures
will neither achieve enduring glory nor lasting happiness and will never
reach the Lord’s abode. (16.23)
Scriptures are your guide in performing right deeds and avoiding
wrong ones. Therefore, perform your prescribed duties as per scriptural
injunctions. (16.24)
Comments: After having described the three main emotions that
cause one to indulge in harmful activities, the next three verses describe the
method for one to get freed from the clutches of these emotions. The Lord

Chapter 16

365

states that one should resort to scriptures which act as guidelights for
seekers on the journey of life. Scriptures such as the Upanishads, the
Bhagavata, the Ramayana and of course, the Mahabharata contain
many episodes to help a seeker discriminate between moral and immoral
actions, especially where there are grey areas.
Summary of Chapter 16
Some of the characteristics of the divine and the demoniac were
described in chapter 9, verses 9.11-14. This chapter provides more details
on these characteristics. People with divine natures typically exhibit the
following traits: honesty, straightforwardness, compassion, gentleness,
sense control, peace of mind, pleasing personality, helpfulness, anger
control, purity in body and mind, charitable nature. These are covered in
verses 16.1-3. Those with demoniac natures are characterized by some of
these traits: arrogance, anger, obstinacy, attachment to worldly pleasures,
disrespect towards teachers and elders, conceit, cruelty, hypocrisy etc.
These are described in verses 16.7-18. The destination for those with
demoniac conduct (a result of their demoniac nature) is described in verses
16.19-21. Verses 16.22-23 describe the methods for one to overcome
demoniac tendencies. This chapter concludes in verse 16.24 with Lord
Krishna declaring that one needs to resort to the scriptures to discriminate
between right and wrong actions.

Chapter 17 - The Threefold Faith
Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 28 verses is termed
Shraddhatraya Vibhaga Yoga (The Threefold Faith). In the previous
chapters, especially in chapter 14, the nature of individuals influenced by
the qualities of sattv, rajas, tamas was stated in many places. This chapter
has more details on the concept of threefold faith. In chapter 14, verse
14.19, it was stated that all activities are influenced by the combination of
the three qualities of inert nature and that the Lord Almighty is beyond
these attributes and hence is not influenced by them. Everyone has faith or
belief about the purpose of life. This belief is born out of their innate
nature. In this chapter, more details on the impact of the innate qualities of
living beings are described, especially on issues such as faith, food habits,
austerity, and charitable giving. While chapter 14 dealt with the impact of
the three qualities of nature on living beings, this chapter deals with the
three types of faith that are intrinsic to all living beings.

Arjuna said: O Krishna! Some worship and perform sacrifices with
sincerity, but without knowing scriptural procedures. What is their
conviction? Is it sattvic (virtuous), rajasic (passion) or tamasic
(ignorance)? (17.1)
Comments: In the last verse of the previous chapter 16.24, the Lord
stated that the scriptures are the guidelights for a seeker to discriminate
between right and wrong deeds. Arjuna wants to know about those who do

not know about scriptural procedures. If they perform deeds with sincerity,
would they be sattvic, rajasic or tamasic?
Outwardly, the phrase śāstravidhim utsṛjya seems to refer to those
who ignore the procedures indicated in the scriptures. Sri Rayaru in GV
based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GB states that this phrase refers to those who
do not have knowledge about scriptural procedures. After all, not everyone
has access to the scriptures, yet they also perform meditation, charity etc.,
based on their belief system. The question that Arjuna is asking is about the
nature of their activities. This will be clear after Lord’s response in the next
two verses.

The Lord said: Living beings are predisposed (based on their innate
nature) into one of three qualities - sattvic, rajasic or tamasic. Listen to
their description. (17.2)

predisposition. The Lord describes such predisposition.

O Bharata! Everyone’s faith is conditioned according to the innate

Comments: Intrinsic predisposition in living beings defines their
faith. It is this faith that is the basis of one’s attitudes, personality, and
activities. When one is liberated, one’s state will be based on one’s intrinsic

368

The Bhagavad Gita

predisposition (sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic). Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that
despite one’s intrinsic predisposition, one may exhibit other characteristics
to a small extent based on the impact of one’s environment. Intrinsic
predisposition in souls is like the feature of magnetism in magnets which
naturally attracts iron but no other metals. Magnetism in that sense is an
intrinsic quality that cannot be separated from a magnet. Sri Madinur
Vishnu Teertha in his BGS has identified this verse as representing the core
concepts in this chapter as it identifies the root cause that determines one’s
faith.

Sattvic individuals worship godly deities. Rajasic individuals’

forces worship evil spirits. (17.4)
Some people with arrogance and pride, driven by lust and desire,
perform rigorous rituals not approved by the scriptures, ignoring the five
basic elements of nature (and their governing deities), Mother Nature
(Goddess Mahalakshmi), as well as Myself (Krishna), all resident in their
bodies. They are of demoniac nature. (17.5) (17.6)
Comments: The types of spirits worshipped by sattvic, rajasic and
tamasic beings are identified in these verses. When the sattvic propitiate

Chapter 17

369

deities such as Brahma, Indra etc., due to their faith in Lord Almighty
Vishnu, they envision the indwelling Lord Vishnu in these deities, and
hence will attain His abode (moksha). Others such as rajasas who
propitiate these deities without considering the indwelling Lord are
propitiating other capricious spirits with the same name as Brahma, Indra
etc. They will only experience temporary rewards in a heaven like abode.
This is clarified by Sri Rayaru in GV.
Habits of Food, Rituals, Austerity and Charity

Food preferred by living beings are also of three types. Likewise, are
sacrificial rituals, austerity, and charitable activities. Listen to their
classification. (17.7)
Comments: The innate nature of living beings impacts their lives in
terms of food habits, performance of daily rituals, and even their attitude
and approach towards charitable giving. These are explained in detail in
verses 17.8 to 17.22.
As per the Chandogya Upanishat (6.5.1), food items have three
components – gross, middle part and subtle part. The gross part is normally
excreted, the middle part gives nourishment to the body and the subtle part
impacts the mind. Hence, the type of food consumed not only impacts ones
physical health, but also has an impact on one’s mental health.

The Bhagavad Gita

Sattvic (virtuous) people like food items that are pleasant,
nourishing, sweet, tasty, and are easy to digest. They enhance longevity,
vitality, and health, and induce happiness and good nature. (17.8)
Comments: ‘You are what you eat’ is a famous saying which
indicates that ones nature is defined by one’s food habits. Those with
sattvic nature prefer food items that promote health and longevity. These
food items are endowed with four basic characteristics which make them
tasty (rasyāḥ), juicy (snigdhāḥ), nourishing (sthirā), and hearty (hṛdyā). An
example of nourishing (sthirā) food is ghee which stays in the blood stream
for a long-time giving strength to the individual. Hearty (hṛdyā) food items
are those (ex: sweet dishes) which not only give joy while they are
consumed but also create craving. Moderate amounts of such healthy, tasty
food promote health and wellbeing, and induce good nature. Sri
Vidyasagara Madhava Teertha gives the example of a lamp that requires
both the wick (batti) and ghee/oil to give light. Similarly, a body needs
ghee for nourishment which helps to light one’s intellect.

Rajasic (passionate) people like food items that are extremely
bitter/spicy, acidic, salty, hot, pungent, sour, and burnt. These result in
misery and discomfort at the time of consumption, and disease later. (17.9)
Comments: This verse describes the food habits of the rajasic.
While food items which are sour, salty etc., are also essential for one’s
wellbeing, they need to be consumed in moderation. When consumed in
excess (atī), they result in misery at the time of consumption. Long term ill
effects include onset of diseases. For example, while salt is an essential
source of sodium for the body, excess intake of salt over a prolonged period
is known to result in high blood pressure. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that
these food items when consumed in moderation and without resulting in
discomfort or disease, can be considered sattvic.

to the tamasic. Impure food items include prohibited ones such as alcohol.
These food items are unhealthy regardless of the amount that is consumed.

expectations and as an outward show of power and wealth, is rajasic.
(17.12)
Ritual sacrifices performed without following scriptural procedures,
without feeding the needy, without proper chanting of hymns, without
donating to charity, and without sincerity is tamasic. (17.13)

372

The Bhagavad Gita

Comments: Sattvic ones perform ritual sacrifices as worship to the
Lord. Feeding the needy and charitable giving are integral parts of any
ritual sacrifice performed to propitiate deities. Those with rajasic nature,
perform ritual sacrifices as a show to demonstrate their power in society.
Those with tamasic natures perform such rituals with ulterior motives and
never donate to those less fortunate.

Respecting and worshipping deities, scholars, teachers and learned
ones, purity in mind and body, honesty, celibacy, and non-violence are
physical austerities. (17.14)
Using words and speech that do not cause anxiety in others, that are
pleasant to hear, that are truthful and aid in spiritual study constitutes
austerity of words. (17.15)
Serenity in thinking, pleasant nature, purity in thoughts, an
uncluttered mind, and a mind focused on the Lord constitute austerity of
the mind. (17.16)
Comments: Austerity is self-discipline that is visible in one’s
actions. It has three components: physical, vocal, and mental. One’s nature
is also influenced by one’s attitude and approach to austerity. Those with

Chapter 17

373

sattvic nature engage in physical austerity characterized by respect to
deities, elders, teachers etc., in addition to internal and external purity of
purpose. Their vocal austerity manifests in the words they choose in their
discussions, as also the tone and tenor of their voice. Mental austerity is
characterized by an uncluttered, tranquil, silent mind which is steadfastly
focused on the Lord.

Austerity sincerely observed by people is also of three types. Sattvic
austerity is one that is performed as an offering to the Lord, without any
expectation. (17.17)
Austerity performed to display one’s wealth and position, and to gain
adulation and praise from society, resulting in uneven, vanishing rewards is
rajasic. (17.18)
Austerity performed out of superstitions, with great pain to the self
and with the intention of harming others is tamasic. (17.19)
Comments: After having identified the characteristics of austerity
exercised physically, vocally, and mentally, the next three verses describe
the differences in the attitude and approach of those with sattvic, rajasic,
and tamasic natures. Sattvic ones exercise austerity as service to the Lord,

374

The Bhagavad Gita

the rajasic approach austerity with an ulterior motive of societal
recognition, and for the tamasic, austerity is meant to hurt others.

Charity given to the deserved with a feeling of duty, at appropriate

Charity given unwillingly, as if to return a favour and given with an
expectation of returns, is rajasic. (17.21)
Charity given to the undeserving, with disrespect and without regard
to appropriateness of place and time is tamasic. (17.22)
Comments: Charitable donations performed by individuals are also
of three types. The sattvic donate whole heartedly without any expectation
of recognition and consider it their duty. Their only goal is to please the
Lord. The rajasic donate out of fear (of reprisals afterlife), out of
expectations of societal recognition, often with unlawful earnings. The
tamasic donate with ulterior motives to the undeserving with disrespect.

In the scriptures, the Lord is addressed with three principal namesOm (omnipresent), Tat (one who is known indirectly, through the Vedas)
and Sat (full of infinite auspicious attributes). The Lord made available the
Vedas and Vedic sacrifices and powered the intellect of priests to perform
them. (17.23)
Comments: Sattvic living beings perform all their activities,
especially ritual sacrifices, austerity, and charitable giving as a worship and
offering to the Lord. It is important for one to remember the Lord before
undertaking such activities. The next four verses state that the scriptures
address the Lord with three succinct, yet powerful adjectives, Om, Tat and
Sat. These have special meanings. Om which is derived from ‘otam
protaha’ refers to the one who indwells (and supports) the universe. Tat
means one who pervades the Gunas (qualities). It also means one who
cannot be comprehended by the sense organs and can only be known
through the scriptures. Sat refers to the Lord who is devoid of any defects
and is full of infinite, auspicious attributes.

The Bhagavad Gita

Hence, the activities of ritual sacrifice, austerity, and charity
performed as per the scriptures are always initiated by invoking the
primordial syllable ‘Om’, as a prayer to the Lord Almighty. (17.24)
Those desirous of achieving eternal bliss and not interested in
temporary heavenly pleasures perform sacrifices, penances, and charity as
an offering to the Lord described by the word ‘Tat’, as one who is to be
understood indirectly (through the scriptures). (17.25)
O Partha! The Lord’s name, ‘Sat’, is used to represent existence and
goodness. It is also used to denote auspicious activities. (17.26)
Comments: These three verses describe the impact of invoking the
Lord’s names Om, Tat, Sat at the time of performing activities such as
ritual sacrifices, austerity, and charitable giving. Invoking the Lord’s name
Om, ensures that these activities will be rendered sattvic. Before chanting
any hymn, one must precede it with Om, which renders the hymn fruitful.
Likewise, one must complete chanting of hymns with Om in the end, else
any blessings that would accrue from the hymn would be lost.
When one invokes the Lord’s name Tat, one is reminded that the
Lord is knowable indirectly (through the scriptures) and that one should
perform activities without expectations of temporary rewards.
Invoking the Lord’s name Sat will remind a seeker to be aware of the
Lord’s infinite, auspicious attributes, and activities such as the creation of
the universe.
In summary, invoking the phrase Om, Tat, Sat at the time of
performing virtuous activities will help a seeker develop a virtuous attitude
and approach to them.

The strong conviction that one has in performing sacrifices, penances
and charity is also represented by the Lord’s name ‘Sat’, as also activities
that are performed as an offering to the Lord. (17.27)
O Partha! Sacrifices performed, charity given, and austerities
observed, if done without faith and devotion to the Lord will be
counterproductive and constitute ‘Asat’. Such activities help neither here
nor hereafter. (17.28)
Comments: The Lord concludes the discussion of ‘The Threefold
Faith’ with these two verses by summarizing the characteristics of activities
performed with sincerity and those performed without sincerity. Activities
performed with sincerity, without expectations of rewards and as an
offering to the Lord will indeed help a seeker reach the Lord’s abode.
Activities that are performed with ulterior motives for societal recognition,
without following scriptural procedures and without offering to the Lord
are inauspicious and will neither help in this world nor in afterlife. Hence
faith and sincerity are very essential when performing activities.
Summary of Chapter 17
In this chapter the Lord identifies the three divisions of faith - sattvic,
rajasic and tamasic which influence the attitudes and activities of living
beings. These attributes are innate (swabhava) to individual souls. The
impact of these attributes on activities such as worship, food habits, ritual
sacrifices, austerity, and charitable services are described. Verses 17.4 to
17.7 describe the mode of propitiation of living beings. Verses 17.8 to

378

The Bhagavad Gita

17.10 describe food habits. Verses 17.11 to 17.13 identify ritual sacrifices
based on one’s innate attributes. Verses 17.14 to 17.19 describe one’s
approach to austerity and meditation. Verses 17.20 to 17.22 address the
issue of charitable giving. Verses 17.23 to 17.27 describe the approach
towards ritual sacrifices and penance performed by sattvic beings desirous
of moksha, with special explanation on Om, Tat, and Sat, the three principal
names of the Lord Almighty.

Chapter 18 - Liberation and Renunciation
Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 78 verses is termed
Mokshasanyasa Yoga (Liberation and Renunciation). It starts with a
discussion on the subtle differences between renunciation (sanyasa) and
relinquishment of rewards from labour (tyaga). The types of rewards from
actions are also discussed. The five prerequisites of performing any action
are identified. Different types of knowledge, action, doers, intellect,
determination, and happiness are also discussed. Additional details are
provided on four societal categories of people which were briefly indicated
in 4.13. The concept of liberation (moksha) is discussed in detail in this
chapter. The first 55 verses contain discussions on the topics identified so
far. The Lord concludes His sermon in the next 17 verses. Arjuna responds
to Lord Krishna’s entire teaching in verse 73. Sanjaya, who has been
describing the proceedings in the war to King Dhrutarashtra concludes his
commentary in the remaining 5 verses. Arjuna starts by requesting Krishna
to explain the difference between renunciation (sanyasa) and
relinquishment (tyaga) as both seem to imply the same. The Lord provides
answers to Arjuna’s questions with a detailed description of the various
aspects of renunciation and relinquishment. This chapter expands on the
concept of doership, provides more details on the influence of the three
qualities of nature and gives additional explanation on societal categories.
There is further an elaborate discussion on the methods to achieve salvation
(moksha). The Lord also describes the glory of the Gita.

Arjuna said: O Krishna, Mighty Armed One! O Hrishikesha! O
Slayer of Demon Keshi! I would like to understand the difference between
renunciation and relinquishment. (18.1)
Comments: In verse 5.2, it was stated that renunciation (sanyāsa) is
essential to attain liberation (moksha), and in verse 12.12 relinquishment
(tyāga) was lauded as a superior means to attain liberation (moksha).
Arjuna wants to know the difference between these two approaches. The
Lord provides a detailed response to Arjuna in verses 18.2 to 18.12.

The Lord said: Learned ones say that renunciation is the
abandonment of activities performed for the sake of desired outcomes. The
experienced say that relinquishment is forsaking of fruits of any action.
(18.2)
The wise declare that engaging in desire ridden activities should be
relinquished as they entangle a soul. Others say that one should never
abandon activities such as ritual sacrifice, charity, and penance. (18.3)
Comments: The Lord identifies four principles in these verses – (i)
abandonment of activities performed for mundane desires (ii) forsaking any
rewards from action (except the lofty goal of earning the Lord’s grace) (iii)
abandonment of activities which entangle one, and (iv) non-abandonment
of prescribed activities of ritual sacrifices, charity, and austerity. Sri
Madhwacharya in GB and GTN clarifies that all these principles are
required for one to make progress in one’s spiritual journey. The use of

Chapter 18

381

terms ‘kavayo’ (learned ones), ‘vicakṣaṇāḥ’ (the experienced),
and‘manīṣiṇaḥ’ (the wise) to describe the proponents of these four
principles is proof that all four are desirable qualities in a seeker.

O Superior among the Bharatas! Listen to My ruling on the issue of
relinquishment. O Superior among Men! Relinquishment is of three types.
(18.4)
Comments: To clarify that there is no contradiction between
renunciation and relinquishment, the Lord states that relinquishment is of
three types. However, these three types are not identified in this verse. Sri
Rayaru in GV describes the three types of relinquishments as follows  As per verse 18.2, relinquishment is forsaking rewards of activities.
 As will be seen in verse 18.6, relinquishment is forsaking ownership
in activities.
 As will be seen in verse 18.17, relinquishment is not assuming
independent doership in activities.
Another interpretation for the types of relinquishments is classification
based on sattvic (pious), rajasic (passionate) and tamasic (ignorant) modes
explained later in verses 18.7 to 18.9.

The Bhagavad Gita

One should never abandon performing prescribed ritual sacrifices,
austerity, and charity. These help purify a person. (18.5)
O Partha! One should detach oneself from ego in actions and
perform them without expectations. This is My definite opinion. (18.6)
Comments: In these two verses, the Lord mandates that one should
never abandon one’s prescribed duties and should perform them without
attachment to the actions themselves and without expectations. As the Lord
states that performing ritual sacrifices, austerity and charity are mandatory
for everyone, how does this apply to ascetics, and to those who do not have
access to Vedic knowledge? Ascetics are prohibited from performing fire
rituals and since they do not earn any income, they cannot perform any
charity. Sri Rayaru in GV states that ritual sacrifices are of different types
as stated earlier in verse 4.25 etc. The ritual sacrifice, for ascetics, is jnana
yagna (sacrifice of knowledge) which involves continuous study of
scriptures, teaching students, lectures to the lay people etc. Charity, for
ascetics, is donating their time and knowledge to those in need. Austerity,
for ascetics, is observing strict rituals such as celibacy, fasting etc. Those
who do not have access to Vedic knowledge perform ritual sacrifice in the
form of prayers and bhajans on the Lord, and austerity for them is being
truthful, fasting etc.

Renouncing prescribed duties is never appropriate. Avoiding such
actions out of ignorance is tamasic. (18.7)
Abandonment of prescribed duties under the pretext of stress and
physical difficulty is rajasic. No one can earn the Lord’s grace through
such renunciation. (18.8)
O Arjuna! Performing prescribed duties without attachment to
actions and without expectations is sattvic renunciation. (18.9)
Comments: In these verses, the Lord identifies the types of
renunciation practiced by different people, based on their intrinsic nature.
Some completely ignore performing prescribed duties out of ignorance or
false knowledge. Such renunciation is tamasic (nescient). There are some
who are aware of their prescribed duties but find excuses such as bodily
discomfort to avoid doing them. Their abandonment is rajasic and does not
earn the Lord’s grace. The sattvic consider their prescribed duties as an
obligation and perform them without attachment and expectations. Their
renunciation of attachment to activities and rewards is sattvic and is to be
followed by everyone.

The Bhagavad Gita

A sattvic renouncer is one who neither despises unpleasant activities
nor craves for pleasant activities, one who offers all activities to the Lord,
one who is pious by nature, one who has understood the Lord, and one who
has no doubts about the nature of the Lord and the Universe. (18.10)
One with a physical body can never completely renounce all
activities (as even breathing is an activity). One who has relinquished the
fruits of labour is the ideal tyagi. (18.11)
Those who perform activities with expectations will experience
either pleasant, or unpleasant, or mixed rewards after they leave this world.
This does not apply to those who perform duties without expectations.
(18.12)
Comments: These three verses provide more details on the
characteristics of renunciation based on the nature and approach of the
seeker. As per Rayaru in GV, verse 18.10 identifies five characteristics of
a sattvic renunciant as one who (i) does not abandon prescribed duties that
may be momentarily unpleasant, (ii) does not crave for activities that may
be momentarily pleasant, (iii) has a pious nature, (iv) has understood
properly the Lord’s prowess, and (v) has no doubts regarding the
distinction between the universe and the Lord Almighty. Verse 18.11
counters a position that some hold that a renouncer should forsake all
activities. This verse states that for a living being, it is impossible to
forsake all activities, as even breathing is a type of activity. An ideal
renouncer is one who forsakes the rewards from actions and not actions
themselves. Verse 18.12 explains the distinction between a seeker who
performs activities with expectations of rewards and one who performs
prescribed duties with no expectations. The former one experiences three
different types of destinations in afterlife: downfall, heavenly rewards, and
rebirth in this world (depending on the approach and nature of their
activities such as tamasic, sattvic, rajasic). However, one who performs
prescribed duties forsaking rewards will not experience these types of
destinations. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that those seekers who have

Chapter 18

385

achieved self-realization and do not have any obligations to perform
activities, will achieve higher bliss in salvation depending on the extent of
their activities. As indicated in 18.2, renunciation is the abandonment of
activities performed for the sake of desired outcomes, and relinquishment is
forsaking of fruits of any action. Superior seekers who have achieved
self-realization have both these characteristics (renunciation and
relinquishment).

O Arjuna, Mighty Armed One! There are five pre-requisites for
completion of any activity as enumerated in the Sankhya scripture. Learn
them from Me. (18.13)
They are as follows - the place for conducting activity (such as body,
earth), the performer (human, divine), the apparatus (sense organs, fire),
resulting rituals (meditation, prayer) and divinity (the Lord ). (18.14)
Whatever activity one performs through the body or the mind or
speech, whether it is right or wrong, that activity will require the above five
pre-requisites for completion. (18.15)
Comments: As performance of activities is mandatory for everyone,
it is important to understand the prerequisites for performing them. These
verses identify the five prerequisites for action. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies

386

The Bhagavad Gita

that these are as per the Sankhya scripture which was composed by the
Lord in the form of Kapila. Verse 18.14 identifies the five prerequisites,
and verse 18.15 clarifies that these five prerequisites are essential for
performing any activity, be it physical, vocal, or mental.
The concept of prerequisites for activities can be illustrated with an
example. Let us take the case of a seeker practicing meditation (dhyana).
Following are the five prerequisites –
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)

place = physical body
performer = living being (dependent performer)
apparatus = living being’s mind
resulting ritual = focusing the mind
divinity = Lord Almighty (who powers everyone’s actions).

For example, in the case of one cooking rice, these five aspects
are – place (kitchen), performer (cook), apparatus (utensils, stove),
resulting ritual (rice), and divinity (Lord who powers this activity).

Hence the unwise one, who foolishly considers self to be the sole
performer of any action, is indeed devoid of proper knowledge. (18.16)
One who is not under the delusion of being the sole performer and
has no expectation on the outcome of action, will not be termed a killer
even if that person has killed while performing prescribed duties. Such a
person is not tainted with any sin. (18.17)

Chapter 18

387

Comments: These two verses amplify the need for one to be aware
of the concept of doership. As there are five clear prerequisites for the
creation of any activity, no one should be under the delusion of sole,
independent doership. Verse 18.17 goes a step further and states that a
seeker who is not under the delusion of independent doership and performs
prescribed activities with no expectations of rewards, will not be tainted by
any sin, even if that activity involves destruction of population. This
statement can raise issues as to how one can be absolved of great sins that
normally accompany such destructive activities. Sri Rayaru in GV based on
Sri Madhwacharya’s GB and Sri Jaya Teertha’s PD clarifies this concept
with concrete examples. Lord Rudra (who governs the act of universe’s
dissolution) and Lord Yama (the deity of death) are associated with
destruction. However, these deities perform these activities as directed by
the independent, omniscient Lord Almighty and have no delusion that they
are performing these on their own. Hence, they are not tainted by any sin.
However, deity Indra who kills Vrutasura, was tainted with some sin as his
actions were accompanied by ego.

The motivations for any activity are three-fold - knowledge about the
activity (jnana), effort (prayatna), and the performer of the activity (jeeva).
The three main pre-requisites for any activity are - the apparatus, the
resulting ritual, and the doer. (18.18)
Comments: This verse describes the concept of doership where the
motivations for performing any activity are indicated, along with the
prerequisites for such activities. While verse 18.14 described the five
prerequisites for performing any activity, these five are summarized into 3
types – the apparatus (which combines the place of operation and the
material utilities), the resulting ritual and the doer (which combines the

388

The Bhagavad Gita

independent doer and divinity, both referring to the Lord Almighty). In
addition to the prerequisites that are essential for one to perform any
activity, one also needs motivation to engage in that activity. This verse
identifies the 3 motivators as – knowledge about the activity to be
performed (jnana), effort (prayatna) that one needs to put in and the
performer of the activity (jeeva). The performer of the activity is the living
individual who acts based on the power granted by the Lord. The individual
being is not an independent doer but acts under the control and supervision
of the independent Lord. The concept of doership is explained in detail by
Rayaru in GV based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GB and GTN. This topic was
covered previously in comments for verse 5.14.
One of the questions that arises is about prescribed duties mandated
in the scriptures. Do they apply to the Lord, individual souls, or inert
matter? Sri Rayaru in GV explains that by the process of elimination, one
can conclude that prescribed duties apply only to individuals. This is
because inert matter cannot act, and the Lord Almighty has no obligation or
mandate to act (verse 3.22). Now, one can question the feasibility of a
living being as a doer, while the real doer is described as the Lord
Almighty. Sri Rayaru clarifies that while the Lord is the independent doer,
living beings are dependent doers. In this sense, the mandates prescribed in
the scriptures apply to living beings who can perform activities based on
the material strength and powers granted to them by the Lord. If the Lord
as the independent doer is responsible for all activities, what is the role of
living beings? Living beings have an intrinsic intent (iccha) to achieve
salvation which leads them to make attempts (prayatna). By the grace of
the Lord, they are given the ability to perform actions. Hence, living beings
are responsible for their actions.

As per Sankhya scriptures, knowledge, activity, and the doer are of
three types and are differentiated based on their natural attributes. Listen to
the explanation with attention. (18.19)
Comments: After having described the prerequisites for actions and
the concepts of doership, the Lord provides a detailed explanation on the
categories of the three aspects of action – knowledge, resulting activity, and
the doer. These aspects are influenced by the three qualities of nature,
namely sattv, rajas, and tamas. The Lord also states the scriptural basis for
this classification as Vedic Sankhya.

That knowledge which is about the nature of the imperishable Lord

Comments: Sattvic knowledge is one which recognizes the same
Lord as being present in different entities in the universe, such as living
beings or inert matter. This verse uses the word ‘bhava’ (one who is
present) to indicate the Lord. Later, in verse 18.61, the Lord explicitly
states that He is present in everyone’s hearts. Hence, the reference in this
verse to the entity residing in everyone, the Lord Almighty Himself. The
concept described in this verse was also stated previously in 13.17 and
5.18.

That knowledge which teaches that everyone and everything in the

Comments: Those with rajasic knowledge are aware that everyone
(living beings) and everything (inert matter) in the universe are different
(pṛthak). However, they do not have firm conviction about the supremacy
of the Lord. This concept is implied using the word ‘tu’ (meaning
‘however’), since the other two components of the universe (living beings
and inert matter) were stated explicitly.

Comments: Sri Rayaru in GV based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GTN
and the Padma Purana, provides three interpretations for this verse based
on the different meanings for the word kṛtsna (complete). This word can
mean either the Lord Almighty or the world. Those with tamasic
knowledge:
(i) believe in the identity of the individual soul and the Lord
(ii) believe in the identity of the individual soul and the inert world
(iii) believe that the world arose from one individual soul, and hence
self-knowledge also implies knowledge about the entire universe

Prescribed activity that is performed without attachment, without

Activities performed without realizing the consequences, not having
lasting rewards, with no regard to one’s abilities, with potential violent
impact on others, and performed with ignorance are tamasic. (18.25)
Comments: These three verses describe the types of activities based
on the influence of the three qualities of nature, sattva, rajas, and tamas.
Sri Rayaru in GV, draws attention to verses mentioned in chapter 3 ((3.30)
and (3.31)), where the Lord had stated that those who perform activities
without expectations, only as an offering to Him, will not be entangled by
the effects of activities. This is the nature of sattvic activities.

One who performs activities to gain fame, has expectations on the
outcome, is miserly, harms others, does not have mental or physical purity,
and is impacted by success or failure of actions, is a rajasic doer. (18.27)
One who performs activities without offering them to the Lord, who
is not strengthened by devotion to the Lord, who is egoistic, who acts with
hatred, who performs heinous activities, who is lethargic, who does not act
with mental firmness, and who is always procrastinating, is a tamasic doer.
(18.28)
Comments: These three verses describe the nature of doers who
perform activities under the influence of the three qualities of nature. Given
that the doers are of three types, it is understandable that the activities
performed by them are also of three types as explained previously in verses
18.23 to 18.25.

(18.30)
O Partha! Not being able to discriminate between virtuous and sinful
activities, confused between prescribed and prohibited activities is due to
rajasic intelligence. (18.31)
O Partha! Intelligence covered by ignorance which considers
unrighteous activities as virtuous ones and which misinterprets reality as
illusion, is tamasic. (18.32)
Comments: In these verses, the faculty of intelligence appears to be
performing the activities indicated. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that
intelligence, being an inert faculty cannot act independently. The activities
stated are performed by an individual whose intelligence is either sattvic,
rajasic, or tamasic. When someone refers to a strong leader as a lion
among people, the implication is that the leader is strong like a lion. It does
not mean that the leader is a lion.

sense gratification with excessive ego, is rajasic. (18.34)
O Partha! The determination with which one is unable to overcome

(18.35)
Comments: Sattvic determination is a result of one’s unflinching
devotion to the Lord even under difficult circumstances. Tamasic
determination leads one to hatred towards the Lord.

O Superior among the Bharatas! Now listen to the three types of
happiness. That happiness which increases with practice, frees one from
distress, feels poisonous in the beginning and turns out to be nectar like
towards the end, is sattvic. This is achieved through peace of mind and the
express grace of the Lord Almighty. (18.36) (18.37)
Comments: The pursuit of unending happiness is every living
being’s goal. However, the type of happiness that one pursues is shaped by
the influence of the three qualities of nature. In verse 18.37, the phrase
‘buddhiprasādajam’ seems to imply that sattvic happiness arises from
peace of mind. The mind is inert. How can the inert mind result in
happiness? Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that this phrase is preceded by ‘atma’
(referring to the Lord Almighty). Hence the implication is that one can
experience sattvic happiness only by the Lord’s grace, which also leads to
peace of mind.

Happiness arising out of the interaction between the sense organs
and the objects of gratification, which initially feels like nectar and turns
out to be poisonous in the end, is rajasic. (18.38)
Happiness arising out of excessive sleep, lethargy, and forgetfulness,
which creates addiction from beginning to end is tamasic. (18.39)
Comments: These two verses describe rajasic and tamasic types of
happiness. Rajasic happiness is that which is experienced bodily through
the sense organs. This excludes the happiness one feels during deep sleep
(sushupti) as one does not have awareness of sense objects in this state.
Examples of tamasic happiness are those experienced due to indulgence in

396

prohibited substances which are known to be addictive as well as
unhealthy.

There is no entity, among those on earth or among the deities in

(18.40)
Comments: This verse states that every living being is influenced by
the three qualities of nature, although in different proportions. Sri Rayaru in
GV clarifies that this does not apply to liberated souls, as this verse
specifically identifies only living beings on earth, and the heavenly deities.
The word ‘punah’ in this verse, indicating ‘and’ as per Sri Satyadhyana
Teertha’s GPC, implies additional aspects not expressly stated in this verse.
Sri Rayaru in GV based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GB and GTN provides
details of these additional aspects such as the proportion of the three
qualities among living beings (humans, deities, and demons alike). For
example, deities have a higher proportion of sattv. Sages have a mixture of
sattv and rajas. Ancestral deities (pitrus) and heavenly musicians
(gandharvas) have a mixture of sattv and tamas. The issue of
categorization among deities based on their innate nature was addressed
earlier in verse 10.6.

governed by their innate nature. (18.41)
Comments: Previously in verse 4.13, the Lord had stated that He
created four categories of people based on the innate nature of souls and
their activities. It must be noted that one is not classified as such based on
one’s family of birth, as these classes are based on one’s innate nature and
talent. Details of the characteristics, attributes, and activities of these four

Valour, brilliance, bravery, diligence, not running away from
justified conflict, charity, and excellence in administration, are the natural
attributes of those with innate kshatriya qualities. (18.43)
Farming, animal (cow) welfare and commerce are the natural
attributes of those with innate vaishya qualities. Service mindedness is the
natural attribute of those with innate sudra qualities. (18.44)

398

The Bhagavad Gita

Comments: These attributes are not absolute. Living beings
normally have different proportions of these attributes. Sri Rayaru states
the example of King Karthaveerya Arjuna who by profession was a
kshatriya ruler but in fact had a higher proportion of brahminical qualities.

Even if imperfect, it is better for one to perform prescribed activities
rather than perfectly perform activities prescribed to others. No one will be

Chapter 18

tainted with sin for performing the activities prescribed based on their
innate nature. (18.47)
O Son of Kunti! One should not avoid performing prescribed
activities, even if there are imperfections. Just like smoke covers fire, all
activities will have some imperfections. (18.48)
Comments: In these verses, the Lord stresses on the importance of
one focusing on performing one’s prescribed duties. The primary
motivation for the Lord’s sermon to Arjuna is to convince Arjuna that he
should engage in the just war to protect his citizens as that is his prescribed
duty. Everyone has a specific role to play in society. Performing prescribed
duties without expectations is the way for one to earn the Lord’s grace. The
Lord who owns everything in the universe has no expectations from
anyone. There are many situations where one may not be able to perform
one’s prescribed duties perfectly. The Lord in verse (18.47) states that one
should never abandon one’s prescribed duty. The Lord recognizes in verse
18.48 that no activity is ever perfect, just like fire is covered by smoke. As
no one is perfect, no action can be perfect. Hence one should not avoid
performing prescribed duties fearing imperfection. This concept was
previously stated in verse 3.35.

Comments: In verse 18.47, the Lord stated that one should focus on
performing one’s prescribed duties even if it cannot be done perfectly. In
this verse, the Lord identifies the conviction that should accompany

400

The Bhagavad Gita

performance of such duties. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that one can
overcome worldly desires (asaktabuddhiḥ sarvatra) by controlling one’s
mind (jitātmā). These are not independent actions but have a causal
relationship (as sense control helps to overcome desires). In verse 18.45,
the term siddhi was interpreted to mean moksha. In this verse, the word
naiṣkarmya is used which also means moksha, and hence the word siddhi
here is interpreted as the means to achieve moksha. The means are
scriptural study, performing virtuous activities to exhaust prarabdha karma
(consequences from accumulated deeds from one’s prior births that must be

The Path to Liberation

O Son of Kunti! The ultimate state of knowledge is spiritual
fulfilment. Now, hear in brief from Me about the way a seeker achieves
spiritual fulfilment and reaches the abode of Brahma. (18.50)
Comments: In the previous verse, the Lord had identified the
approach for a seeker to attain the states that would lead one to liberation.
This verse states that such a seeker would first reach Goddess
Mahalakshmi, who would then recommend that the Lord should grant the
seeker liberation (moksha). Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that ‘brahma’, in this
verse, refers to Goddess Mahalakshmi (apara brahma) and not to the four
faced deity Brahma or the Lord (para brahma). The meaning of ‘brahma’
is based on the context. The interpretation here is consistent with those in
verses 14.3, 14.27 and 18.54. As this chapter is about renunciation and
liberation, the Lord describes the sequential steps for attaining liberation
(moksha) in detail. In verse 18.49, it was stated that one must be rid of the
effects of all activities before being eligible to attain moksha. The next step
is to attain the abode of Mahalakshmi, and finally reach the abode of the
Lord (which is described in verses 18.55 to 18.57). Given this sequence of

Chapter 18

401

steps, it is also appropriate that Brahma in this verse is interpreted to mean
Mahalakshmi.

To achieve spiritual fulfilment, one must have the following
characteristics: purity of mind, control over the mind with conviction,
overcoming sense gratification, overcoming obsession and avarice,
avoiding crowded places, eating in moderation, focusing the mind and the
body on spiritual pursuits, meditating on the Lord, detaching from worldly
matters, overcoming ego, arrogance, greed, pride, lust, anger, and
tranquility. (18.51) (18.52) (18.53)
Comments: As this final chapter is titled ‘Liberation and
Renunciation’, in these verses, the Lord summarizes the characteristics of a
seeker eligible to achieve liberation. These verses consolidate and
summarize such characteristics which have been previously stated in many
chapters.
Sri Vidyamanya Teertha in GPM delineates the sequence of spiritual
progress based on these characteristics as follows. One who performs
prescribed duties as per one’s innate nature and abilities without
expectations will be able to achieve mental purity. This helps the seeker in
controlling the mind and the sense organs. Detachment from sense objects
helps one to overcome obsession and avarice. Such a seeker naturally
prefers to be alone and avoid crowded places. Consuming sattvic food in
moderation conditions the seeker to overcome emotions such as arrogance,

402

The Bhagavad Gita

greed etc., and withdraw from unnecessary worldly happenings. The seeker
is now ready to focus the mind steadfastly on the Lord and meditate. This
leads the seeker to develop deep devotion in the Lord and perform activities
without any material expectations.

One who has achieved spiritual fulfilment by reaching Goddess
Mahalakshmi (eventually reaching the Lord) has neither cravings nor

Comments: A seeker with the characteristics described in previous
verses will treat everyone equally (seeing the same Lord in everyone) and
will develop devotion to the Lord. This concept was earlier addressed in
verse 5.18.

Chapter 18

Such a person will offer all activities to Me while seeking refuge in
Me. By My grace, that person will attain My abode which is permanent and
imperishable. (18.56)
Offer all your activities to Me with mental conviction and understand
that I am the Supreme One. Focus your mind on Me and follow the path of
spiritual knowledge. (18.57)
Comments: In these three verses, the Lord indicates the reward for
His devotees. They will achieve liberation because of their unflinching
devotion to Him. The Lord expressly states that one can achieve liberation
only through His grace. This indicates that while seekers choose many
different paths for self-realization, ultimately it is only through the Lord’s
grace (matprasādād) that one can achieve everlasting bliss.
Sri Rayaru in GV explains the context for the use of the word
‘matparaḥ’ in this verse. If performing Vedic rituals and submitting them
to the Lord can guarantee liberation, is it possible that trividyas (those who
only go by the superficial interpretations of the Vedas to propitiate other
deities) can also achieve moksha? The Lord answers by including a
qualifier in verse 18.57, in the form of ‘matparaḥ’ which indicates the
supremacy of the Lord Almighty. Hence, one must always have the
conviction in the supremacy of the Lord to achieve liberation.

The Bhagavad Gita

If you focus your mind on Me, you will overcome obstacles through
My grace. If you ignore My words out of arrogance, you will perish.
(18.58)
Out of ego and a sense of independence in activities, if you decide
that you will not wage this war, your resolve will be broken. It is by the
Lord’s will that you will engage in this war. (18.59)
O Son of Kunti! Out of your innate nature, bound by delusion
(resulting from attachment to near and dear ones), if you try to avoid
performing your prescribed duty (of waging this just war), you will be
compelled to act even if you are not so inclined. (18.60)
Comments: After having described the philosophical principles
related to prescribed duties, the Lord now gets back to the issue at hand,
which is convincing Arjuna about the path forward. In these three verses,
the Lord instructs Arjuna on the perils of not performing one’s prescribed
duties. The Lord had stated that one who focuses on performing prescribed
duties will overcome obstacles through His grace. However, if Arjuna were
to ignore the Lord’s advice, he would experience downfall. The Lord goes
a step further and informs Arjuna that he would wage the war even if he
were not inclined to do so, as that was His will. Sri Vadiraja Teertha in
BGL provides another interpretation for the word ‘avaśa’ in 18.60. This
word also means ‘one who is under the control of the Lord’ (as ‘a’ means
Lord and ‘vaśa’ means ‘under the control’). In this case, the context is that
Arjuna will end up waging the war under the control of the Lord Almighty
as that was His will.

O Arjuna! The omnipotent Lord, residing in the hearts of all
machine-like bodies of living beings, propels them to perform various
activities through His own free will. (18.61)

Chapter 18

405

Comments: In the previous verses the Lord stated that one achieves
liberation through His grace. In this verse, the Lord goes a step further and
states that He is present in the hearts of all living beings and propels them
into action. The Lord uses the word ‘yantrā’ (machine) to describe the
physical bodies of living beings. Just as a machine relies on an engine for
running, every physical body depends on its heart for proper functioning.
The Lord states that He resides in the hearts of all living beings. This
concept was also discussed in verse 15.15, where the Lord had stated that
He resides in everyone’s hearts.
Sri Vidyamanya Teertha in his GPM states that this single verse can
be considered to contain the core principles of the entire Gita on the basis
of the logic of ‘sthalee pulaka nyaya’ (where one needs to examine only
one grain of rice to verify if the entire pot of rice is cooked).

O Bharata! Surrender only to Him completely. By His grace, you

Comments: As indicated in the previous verse, the independent
Lord causes everyone to act. Hence, it is important for one to get rid of ego
and surrender to the Lord. Sri Rayaru in GV states that ‘śāśvatam’ (eternal)
here refers to Vaikunta, the abode of the Lord which is embodied by
Goddess Mahalakshmi. Also, in this verse, the Lord uses third person to
indirectly refer to Himself. Sri Rayaru in GV based on Sri Madhwacharya’s
GTN states that the use of third person as opposed to using the first person
clarifies the concepts much more forcefully.

Comments: At first glance, the Lord’s concluding direction to
Arjuna stated in ‘yathecchasi tathā kuru’ seems to indicate that the Lord
gave freedom to Arjuna to do as he wishes. Sri Rayaru in GV based on Sri
Madhwacharya’s GTN states that this is a rhetorical direction from the
Lord and is not to be interpreted literally. The real purport of this direction
is to ask Arjuna if he will act against the Lord’s teachings even after
contemplating on them. This will be clear after a review of Arjuna’s
response in 18.73 where he states that he would act as per Krishna’s words
(kariṣye vacanaṁ tava) and not as per his own wishes.

Comments: After having concluded His teachings on the ways and
means (prameya = principles) for one to traverse the spiritual path, the
Lord now gives Arjuna the concrete steps (sadhana = actions) that he needs
to take to achieve success here and hereafter. Previously in 12.20, the Lord
has identified the characteristics of a devotee who is dear to Him. By
declaring in this verse that Arjuna is dear to Him, the Lord is confirming
that Arjuna has all the desirable traits of an ideal devotee.

As you are dear to Me, immerse your mind in Me. Place your

Comments: The Lord instructs Arjuna to worship only Him with the
four-way procedure – through the mind, through devotion, through
propitiation and through salutation. By using the word ‘satyaṁ’, the Lord is
assuring Arjuna that there should not be any doubt in his mind about him
achieving liberation.
Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in BGS has identified this verse as
containing the essence of this entire chapter. Arjuna was asking for specific
directions from Krishna as he was indecisive about the war. In this verse,
the Lord specifically directs Arjuna to worship Him through the four-way
procedure and confirms that Arjuna would achieve moksha following this
path. Hence this verse can be considered as the core verse of this chapter
(which is known as moksha sanyasa yoga).

Renounce all activities (not related to the Lord or performed with
expectations of temporary rewards) completely and surrender exclusively
to Me. I will liberate you from all your sins and grant you bliss. Do not
lament. (18.66)
Comments: This is a continuation of the previous verse where the
Lord had instructed Arjuna to engage in exclusive four-way worship of
Him. One should not interpret ‘sarvadharmān parityajya’ to mean that one

408

The Bhagavad Gita

should renounce all activities. The Lord had instructed Arjuna many times
to focus on performing the prescribed duty of waging the war (verses
(2.37), (4.42), (11.33)). Also, Sri Madhwacharya in GB reminds one that
the Lord Himself had stated in verse 18.11 that renouncing activities
(tyaga) mean relinquishing rewards from activities.
Sri Vidyesha Teertha in his book, Prana Tattva in the Gita [GPH],
provides an alternate interpretation for this verse based on the word
derivation of ‘māmekaṁ’ as ma + me + kam, where ma = do not; me = to
Me, ka = Vayudeva. In comments to verse 11.40, it was indicated that the
word ‘sarva’ also refers to the Lord Almighty (based on the Lord’s
attribute of omnipresence) and this interpretation is supported by
Upanishads and Vishnu Sahasra Nama. Hence, sarva dharma refers to
Dharmic activities related to the Lord. The reference to the deity Vayudeva
here is in recognition of his status as supreme among all living beings
(jivas). In comments to verse 1.31, Sri Rayaru in GV interpreted the word
‘keshava’, referring to Lord Krishna as one who controls even deities ‘ka’
(Brahma, Vayudeva) and ‘isha’ (Rudra). Now, with the above word
derivation for ‘māmekaṁ’, verse 18.66 can also be interpreted as
follows – “Do not renounce Dharmic activities (related to the Lord),
surrender to Vayudeva and Me. I will liberate you from all your sins and
grant you bliss. Do not lament”.

Never teach this to one who is not devoted to Me and to one who does not

hatred towards Me. (18.67)

Chapter 18

409

Comments: This verse identifies four characteristics of those who
are unsuitable for receiving the teachings of the Gita. Sri Rayaru in GV
provides an interesting interpretation for the use of the word ‘cā’ (which
means ‘and’) in this verse to relate these four characteristics. This word
implies progressive harm in teaching the Gita to such categories of people.
Teaching those who are not austere is harmful. Teaching those who do not
serve teachers/elders is more harmful than teaching those who are not
austere. Teaching those who are not devoted to the Lord is even more
harmful than teaching those who do not serve teachers/elders. Finally,
teaching those who have hatred towards the Lord is most harmful. The use
of the word ‘kadācana’ (meaning ‘never’) indicates that even if someone
were to preach the Gita to those who may not be sufficiently austere or
may not adequately serve their elders/teachers, it should never be taught to
those not devoted to the Lord.

There is none dearer to Me among humans than one who imparts this

to Me than such a person even in future. (18.69)
Comments: The Lord indicates that the one who imparts the
knowledge of the Gita is very dear to Him at the current time and will be
so even in future. Such a person will develop deep devotion in the Lord and

410

The Bhagavad Gita

will ultimately reach Him. This is the power of learning, understanding,
and then teaching the Gita to the faithful. The Lord specifically identifies
those among humans (manuṣyeṣu) who are dearest to Him. Sri Rayaru in
GV states that the intention of specifically identifying humans here is to
clarify that the deities also impart the knowledge of the Gita and they will
be eligible for superior rewards.

in GV that the Lord also goes by the name of Dharma as He is the one who
supports everyone and everything in this universe. Hence studying subjects
related to the Lord is a means to realize the Lord.

Comments: This verse describes the rewards for eligible seekers
who listen to the great conversation (the Gita). Sri Rayaru in GV draws
attention to the use of the word ‘api’ in this verse (‘api’ means ‘also’)

Chapter 18

411

which implies that those who listen to the Gita also achieve the higher
worlds. So, it goes without saying that those who strive harder performing
activities such as studying the Gita and teaching the Gita to devotees will
reap even higher rewards such as exuberant bliss in moksha.

Comments: In this verse Arjuna responds to Lord Krishna
enthusiastically by stating that his delusion has dissipated, and he is now
firmly convinced about his duty of waging the war to protect his citizens.
There are three important points that must be noted here (i) The Lord had asked Arjuna in the previous verse if Arjuna had
listened to His sermon with attention and got all his doubts removed.

412

The Bhagavad Gita

Arjuna states that his doubts have been cleared because of the Lord’s grace
(tvatprasādāt). This implies that in addition to one's effort, one needs the
Lord’s grace to succeed in any venture
(ii) Arjuna indicates that his sense of duty has been awakened. This
implies that Arjuna (who is an incarnation of deity Indra and was well
versed in divine knowledge) had knowledge about his prescribed duties,
but that knowledge had been temporarily lost. Hence, he is stating that his
memory of divine knowledge has returned (smṛtir labdhā)
(iii) In verse 18.63, it was stated that the Lord’s concluding direction
to Arjuna stated in ‘yathecchasi tathā kuru’ was a rhetorical direction from
Him. It was by no means granting Arjuna the freedom to do what he
wished. In this verse, Arjuna does not state that he would act as per his
wishes but that he would act as per the Lord’s words - ‘kariṣye vacanaṁ
tava’. This confirms that the direction from Krishna to Arjuna in verse
18.63 was indeed rhetorical. Acting as per the Lord’s words is the real
meaning of sharanagati (surrender) indicated in 18.66.

also able to behold. He describes the event as yielding him ‘puṇyaṁ’
(rewards hereafter). Previously in verse 11.10, Sanjaya had briefly
described the wonderful, universal form of the Lord which he was also able
to behold.

The Bhagavad Gita

It is my firm belief that wherever there is the presence of Lord
Krishna (the Lord of all Yogas) and Arjuna, the holder of the bow, there
will be abundance of wealth, victory, glory, and everlasting justice. (18.78)
Comments: Sensing Dhrutarashtra’s curiosity about the side that
won the war, Sanjaya indirectly answers the king by stating that the side
that has Krishna and Arjuna will always be victorious.
This verse can also be interpreted to indicate victory for the side that
had the presence of Lord Krishna and deity Vayudeva. HH Sri Vidyasagara
Madhava Teertha provides the following explanation for interpreting this
verse as indicating primarily the presence of deity Vayudeva along with
Lord Krishna. As the Gita is a direct teaching by Lord Krishna, only
Vayudeva (who is superior most among the individual souls) can
comprehend the teachings fully. Arjuna, who has an instance of Indra can
receive the teachings in the Gita only because of special powers granted to
him by Vayudeva. Sri Madhwacharya has stated in MBTN, Chapter 12,
verse 129 that Vayudeva had a special presence in Arjuna in the form of
‘Veera’. In a conversation between Hanuman (a direct of incarnation of
Vayudeva) and Bheema (another incarnation of Vayudeva) in the
Mahabharata, Hanuman assures Bheema that during the Mahabharata
war, he would be present on the flag of Arjuna’s chariot and destroy the
enemies by a mere roar. This is the reason for Arjuna being referred to as
‘kapi dwaja’ (verse 1.20). This incident is narrated by Sri Madhwacharya
in MBTN, chapter 22, verse 288. The phrase ‘yatra pārthodhanurdharaḥ’
in this verse can also be derived as ‘yatra pārtho adhanurdharaḥ’, where
partha (son of Kunti) can be a reference to Bheema and adhanurdharaḥ is
an adjective that can be applied to Bheema as one who can fight a war
without any weapon (as dhanus means weapon). Atharva Upanishat (4.5)
compares a bow to the primordial syllable Om (which is the root of all
knowledge), the arrow to the mind of a seeker and the Lord Almighty to the
target, implying that one must focus one’s mind on the Lord using the
wisdom of the Vedas to reach Him. Sri Madhwacharya in his commentary
on Taittireeya Upanishat, interprets Bheema as the holder of all Vedic

Chapter 18

415

knowledge and hence the word ‘dhanurdharaḥ’ (holder of bow) can be
interpreted to mean Bheema [GPH]
Now, the verse 18.78 can also be interpreted as follows - It is my
firm belief that wherever there is the presence of Lord Krishna (the Lord of
all Yogas), and Vayudeva, there will be abundance of wealth, victory,
glory, and everlasting justice.

Summary of Chapter 18
This chapter has 78 verses. The first 55 verses contain the
conversation between Arjuna and Krishna regarding clarifications on
concepts previously covered in other chapters. The Lord concludes His
teaching in the next 17 verses. Arjuna thanks the Lord in the 73rd verse. The
last 5 verses have concluding remarks from Sanjaya. Arjuna begins by

416

The Bhagavad Gita

asking Krishna what the difference between renunciation (saṁnyāsa) and
relinquishment (tyāga) was, as both seem to imply the same. In verse (5.2),
it was stated that renunciation (sanyāsa) was essential to attain liberation
(moksha), and in verse 12.12, relinquishment (tyāga) was lauded as a
superior means to attain liberation (moksha). Arjuna wants to know about
relative merits of these two approaches. The Lord provides answers to
Arjuna’s questions with a detailed description of the various aspects of
renunciation and relinquishment in verses 18.2 to 18.12. In chapter 5
(verses 14, 15) the concept of doership of activities was briefly described.
This aspect is expanded in this chapter in verses 18.13 to 18.18. In chapter
2, verse 45, it was stated that a seeker must strive to understand the inner
meanings of rituals indicated in the Vedas and not just accept the
superficial meaning. This point is elaborated in this chapter. In chapter 14,
the influence and impact of the three qualities of nature on living beings
was discussed. In this chapter, additional aspects of the qualities of nature
are elaborated in verses 18.19 to 18.39. Previously, in verse 4.13, the Lord
identified the categorization of the society based on the innate nature and
activities of individuals. In this chapter, this concept is elaborated in verses
18.40 to 18.48. Verses 18.49 to 18.55 provide details of the methods for
one to achieve salvation (moksha), as that is the goal of all living beings.
Verses 18.68 to 18.71 describes the glory of the Gita (more details on
Gita’s glory appears in Annexure 1). Sanjaya concludes his commentary on
the battleground to King Dhrutarashtra in verses 18.74 to 18.78 and
indirectly answers the King’s question about the side that won the war by
stating that the side that has Lord Krishna and the warrior Arjuna will
always be victorious.

Summary: This passage which extols the virtues of the Gita is from the
epic Varaha Purana. Goddess Dharadevi (the governing deity for earth)
asks Lord Vishnu how human beings (earth dwellers) can realize the Lord
when they are preoccupied with worldly afflictions. The Lord teaches her
about the glory of the Gita which helps human beings navigate the river of

Annexure 1

419

worldly afflictions. The greatness of the Gita as stated by the Lord can be
summarized as follows.
- Those who are engaged in the practice of reciting the Gita will not
be entangled by their actions.
- The place where one finds books on the Gita or ongoing lectures on
the Gita is said to be the home of all great, sacred rivers and
pilgrimage centers.
- It is also the place where great sages and yogis reside. The Lord also
resides there.
- The greatness of the Gita derives from the fact that they are the
words of the Lord Himself in the form of Krishna, who is full of
infinite auspicious attributes.
- One who recites and studies the Gita daily will attain liberation.
- One who utters the word ‘Gita’ at the time of leaving one’s body will
reach the Lord.
- Even those who have sinned will be rid of their sins if they have
read, analyzed, and understood the true meaning of the Gita. They
too achieve salvation.
- Great emperors such as Janaka reached higher destinations due to
their study of the Gita.
One must study the glory of the Gita after completing the study of the
Gita for maximum benefit.

The Bhagavad Gita

Annexure 2 – The Bhagavad Gita: Philosophical
Interpretation
The verses in the Gita have multiple meanings, each of them being
consistent with the overall narrative. The first and the obvious
interpretation is based on the historical meaning of the verses. Another
subtle interpretation is based on the philosophical meaning of the verses.
Sri Madhwacharya places a lot of importance on the philosophical aspects
of the Gita by stating in his Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya (MBTN
2.146) that the Mahabharata is not just a historical account of the lives of
the Pandavas and the Kauravas; it also is a deeply philosophical work. Sri
Pangari Sreenivasacharya’s Gita Vivruti Adhyatma Artha [GVAA] has
examples of multiple interpretations of the verses in the Gita.
It is said that the Bhagavad Gita is an embodiment of dharma (the
righteous way of living). This is further confirmed by reviewing the first
letter of the first verse (1.1) – dhar and the last letter of the last verse
18.78 – ma. Thus, the Gita, which is encapsulated between the letters, dhar
and ma, is an embodiment of dharma.
To illustrate the philosophical interpretation of the Gita, Sri
Vidyasagara Madhava Teertha provides an interesting interpretation of the
first MTNP and last verses which is summarized below -

Y¥Vamï´> CdmM ŸY_©joÌo Hw$éjoÌo g_doVm `w`wËgd… &
_m_H$m… nmÊS>dmü¡d {H$_Hw$d©V g§ÄO` Ÿ&& 1.1&&
The word dhṛtarāṣṭra is comprised of the words dhṛta and rāṣṭra,
where rāṣṭra = worldly miseries and dhṛta = the one bearing. Hence, the
name dhṛtarāṣṭra represents a student, and indeed, all of us who are
immersed in worldly afflictions. The name sañjaya is made up of root
words samyak and jayati (the one who has soundly conquered worldly
miseries) and represents a teacher who has overcome worldly miseries.

Annexure 2

421

Thus, this verse represents a conversation between a student and a teacher.
dharmakṣetra is based on the word dharma (derived from the word
dharana, the one who protects, in other words the Lord Almighty).
kurukṣetra refers to kṣetra with the qualifier kuru which refers to the one
who is duty bound (as derived from the root word kru which indicates
action). Hence kurukṣetra can mean a person’s physical body. The word
māmakā is used by Dhrutarashtra to mean ‘my clan’ where ‘my’ signifies
ego which represents the demoniac forces in our bodies. In another
interpretation, the word ‘ma’ represents knowledge and mamaka means
knowledge that is not evolved (or ignorance). The word pāṇḍavā is derived
from root words padi and gati which means moving towards knowledge,
and hence is a representation of the angelic forces in our bodies who
embody knowledge (jnana). Thus, the Kauravas represent ignorance
(ajnana) and the Pandavas embody knowledge (jnana).
With these interpretations, the first verse can now be translated as
follows:
Dhrutarashtra (one who is enmeshed in worldly affliction) said O Sanjaya (the one who has soundly conquered worldly miseries)! In
Kurukshetra (the physical body) which houses dharmakṣetra (the Lord
Almighty), what was the outcome of the struggle (internal struggle)
between my clan (demoniac forces represented by ignorance) and the
Pandavas (angelic forces representing the knowledge)?
The central concept in the philosophical interpretation of verse (1.1)
is about the internal struggle between the angelic and demoniac forces and
its impact on one’s activities.
Now, the philosophical interpretation of the last verse follows -

`Ì `moJoœa… H¥$îUmo `Ì nmWm} YZwY©a… Ÿ&
VÌ lr{d©O`mo ^y{VY«w©dm Zr{V_©{V_©_ Ÿ&& 18. 78 &&

422

The Bhagavad Gita

This verse is the concluding response by Sanjaya to King
Dhrutarashtra’s question in verse (1.1). Here, Lord Krishna is described as
yogeśvaraḥ (the one who controls all paths and ways to achieve liberation)
since He has described various paths such as karma yoga, jnana yoga,
dhyana yoga, and bhakti yoga for a seeker to achieve liberation. Arjuna, an
incarnation of the deity Indra with an instance of the serpent deity Sesha
(nara) in him is knowledgeable about performing prescribed duties and
represents living beings. With these interpretations, verse 18.78 can now be
translated as follows All actions, where there is the presence of Lord Almighty Krishna
(the Lord of all yogas), and Arjuna (a representative of all living beings),
will through the Lord’s grace result in great riches and success, eventually
leading to liberation.
In summary, the first verse posed a question about the outcome of
the internal struggle between demoniac forces (ignorance) and angelic
forces (knowledge) within all living beings, and the last verse answers by
stating that all actions where there is the presence of the Lord and Arjuna
(one who is aware of prescribed duties) will succeed fully.

Annexure 3 – The Bhagavad Gita and Dvaita Vedanta
Sri Madhwacharya, the great saint, and philosopher of the 12th
century was a proponent of Dvaita Vedanta (philosophy of theistic dualism)
built on the foundational premise of the difference between individual souls
and the Supreme Soul (the Lord Almighty). Sri Madhwacharya has
composed over 37 works with seminal commentaries on the Gita, the
Vedas, the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras, and epics such as the
Ramayana and the Mahabharata. In all his works, he quotes extensively
from these scriptures. In fact, his very first literary work was his
commentary on the Gita (Gita Bhashya). Sri Vyasa Teertha (16th century),
a great philosopher and scholar from Sri Madhwa’s lineage has
summarized the philosophy of Sri Madhwacharya in a single verse,
popularly known as nava prameya (the 9 tenets). In this section, the
relationship between these nine tenets and the teachings from the Gita are
described to emphasize the scriptural basis for Dvaita Vedanta.

The Nine Tenets of Sri Madhwa’s Philosophy
1. Lord Sri Hari is the Supreme Being
2. This world is real
3. The differences (between the Lord, the individual souls, and inert
objects) are real
4. Individual souls are under the control of Lord Sri Hari
5. Individual souls have gradation in attributes
6. Liberation is the ultimate experience of innate happiness
7. Pure devotion to the Lord leads to liberation

424

The Bhagavad Gita

8. Direct knowledge, inference and scriptures are the evidence to
establish the truth
9. The Lord is knowable through the Vedas
As will be seen, these nine principles are woven throughout the
verses in the Gita. Following are some selected verses from the Gita to
establish their correspondence with these nine tenets.
1.

Supremacy of the Lord Almighty: Lord Sri Hari is the
Supreme Entity
(i) Verse 7.7: The Lord states mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiṁcid asti –
there is no entity in the universe that is superior to Me.
(ii) Verse 8.20: The Lord states paras tasmāt tu bhāvonyo – The
Lord is the entity that is independent, superior to and different from
everything in the universe.
(iii) Verse 15.16: The Lord states uttamaḥ puruṣastvanyaḥ
paramātmety udāhṛtaḥ - the entity known as Paramatma is superior
to and different from all other entities.
(iv) Verse 11.43: Arjuna states na tvatsamosty abhyadhikaḥ kutonyo
– there is no one equal to You (Krishna) in this universe. How can
there be any one more superior?

2.

Realism of the world: The world is real
(i) Verse 9.10: The Lord states mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate
sacarācaram – under My direct supervision, Mother Nature creates
this world made of movable and immovable objects (The Lord uses
the term ādhyakṣa which is derived from the word akṣa which means
seeing. The Lord physically oversees the process of creation of the
universe. As the Lord is real, so is the universe).
(ii) Verse 11.7: The Lord states ihaikastham jagat kṛtsnaṁ paśyādya
sacarācaram – look at the entire universe (jagat) situated in Me (The
Lord grants Arjuna divine vision to view the entire universe within
Him).

Annexure 3

425

(iii) Verse 16.8: The Lord states asatyam apratiṣṭhaṁ te jagadāhur
anīśvaram. They say that the world is unreal and is not dependent on
the Lord Almighty (The Lord describes the characteristics of those
with demoniac nature and states that they view the world (jagat) as
unreal, thereby clarifying the principle of the reality of the world).
3.

The fivefold differences (Pancha Bheda) are real
The three entities in the universe, namely, the Lord Almighty, the
individual souls, and inert objects are different from one another.
(i) Verse 13.22: puruṣaḥ prakṛtistho hi bhuṅkte prakṛtijān guṇān.
Individual souls residing in the body, comprised of the elements of
nature, experience emotions through contact with the three attributes
of nature which are inert objects. This establishes the difference
between individual souls and inert objects.
(ii) Verse 13.31: yadā bhūtapṛthagbhāvam ekastham anupaśyati.
The same Lord resides in multitudes of different (pṛthak) living
beings. The entire 17th chapter is about the three types of intrinsic
faith in living beings as indicated by the Lord in verse (17.2) trividhā
bhavati śraddhā dehināṁ sā svabhāvajā - Living beings are
predisposed based on their innate nature into one of three qualities sattvic, rajasic or tamasic. This establishes the differences among
individual souls.
(iii) Verses 13.6 and 13.7 enumerated the different components of
nature that impact an individual’s personality. This establishes the
differences among inert objects.
(iv) Verse 7.4: bhūmir āponalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca|
ahaṁkāra itīyaṁ me bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭadhā||. The Lord states Earth, water, fire, wind, space, mind, intellect, and individuation are
the eight different parts of inert nature that are under My control.
This establishes the difference between the Lord and inert objects,
and among inert objects.
(v) Verse 15.16: The Lord states uttamaḥ puruṣastvanyaḥ
paramātmety udāhṛtaḥ - the entity known as Paramatma is superior

426

The Bhagavad Gita

to and different from all other entities. This establishes the difference
between the Lord and individual souls.
4.

Individual souls are dependent on the Lord (they do not have
independent doership - kartṛtva)
(i) Verse 5.14: The Lord states na kartṛtvaṁ na karmāṇi – living
beings cannot act independently.
(ii) Verse 15.9: The Lord states śrotraṁ cakṣuḥ sparśanaṁ ca
rasanaṁ ghrāṇam eva ca| adhiṣṭhāya manaś cāyaṁ viṣayān
upasevate|| - The Lord resides in the sense organs - ears, eyes, skin,
tongue, nose, and mind and verily consumes the (righteous) objects
of sense pursuits. This clarifies that living beings are dependent on
the independent Lord Almighty.
(iii) Verse 18.61: The Lord states īśvaraḥ sarvabhūtānāṁ
hṛddeśerjuna tiṣṭhati| bhrāmayan sarvabhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni
māyayā|| - O Arjuna! The omnipotent Lord, residing in the hearts of
all living beings, propels them to perform various activities through
His own free will. This further confirms that living beings are
dependent on the independent Lord Almighty.

5.

Individual souls have gradations
Individual souls have different innate capabilities and eventually
attain different states.
(i) Verse 16.5: The Lord states daivī saṁpad vimokṣāya - Divine
nature paves the way for levels of liberation. vimokṣā is derived as
vividha + mokṣā, meaning different levels of bliss in liberation based
on the innate abilities (yogyata) and efforts (sadhana) of souls.
(ii) Verse 17.2: The Lord states trividhā bhavati śraddhā dehināṁ sā
svabhāvajā - Living beings are predisposed based on their innate
nature into one of three qualities - sattvic, rajasic or tamasic.
(iii) Verse 3.42: The Lord states indriyāṇi parāṇy āhur indriyebhyaḥ
paraṁ manaḥ| manasas tu parā buddhir yo buddheḥ paratas tu saḥ||
- It is said that the sense organs are superior, and the mind is more

Annexure 3

427

superior to them. The intellect is superior to the mind and ultimate
consciousness is even more superior to the intellect. Here the entities
of the sense organs, the mind and the intellect refer to the respective
governing deities. This establishes gradation among the deities.
6.

Liberation is the ultimate state of innate happiness
(i) Verse 14.27: The Lord states śāśvatasya ca dharmasya
sukhasyaikāntikasya ca. Moksha is defined as the state of pure,
unending bliss.
(ii) Verse 18.71: The Lord states sopi muktaḥ śubhāṁl lokān
prāpnuyāt puṇyakarmaṇām – (the one who listens to our
conversations) will be liberated and will be in the world of exalted,
virtuous souls.

7.

Pure devotion leads to liberation
(i) Verse 8.22 – The Lord states puruṣaḥ sa paraḥ pārtha bhaktyā
labhyas tv ananyayā - The Supreme One is reachable only by pure,
unadulterated devotion.
(ii) Verse 11.54 – the Lord states bhaktyā tv ananyayā śakya aham
evaṁvidhorjuna - Only by single minded devotion can one
understand Me.
(iii) Verse 12.20 – the Lord states śraddadhānā matparamā bhaktās
tetīva me priyāḥ - One who observes these methods sincerely, with
deep faith and devotion in Me, is indeed very dear to Me.
(iv) Verse 18.68 – the Lord states ya imaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ
madbhakteṣv abhidhāsyati| bhaktiṁ mayi parāṁ kṛtvā mām
evaiṣyaty asaṁśayaḥ|| - One who imparts this highly secretive
knowledge to My devotees will develop deep devotion to Me and
will reach My abode. Let there not be any doubt in this.
(v) Verse 14.26 – The Lord states māṁ ca yovyabhicāreṇa
bhaktiyogena sevate| sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahmabhūyāya
kalpate|| - One who worships Me with pure, unalloyed devotion will
indeed be able to reach beyond the three qualities and attain the

428

The Bhagavad Gita

abode of Mother Nature - Goddess Mahalakshmi (which is also My
abode).
8.

The three types of evidence are the sources of knowledge
The methods of obtaining true knowledge constitute a fundamental
part of epistemology. Sri Madhwacharya defines the means of
knowledge (pramanas) as pratyaksha (sense perception), anumana
(inference) and agama (scriptural). Pratyaksha is the contact of a
defectless sense organ with a defectless object. Anumana is
defectless syllogism.Aagama is defectless verbal composition
(ex: Vedas).
(i) Verse 11.5: The Lord states paśya me pārtha rūpāṇi śataśotha
sahastraśaḥ| nānāvidhāni divyāni nānāvarṇākṛtīni ca|| The Lord
asks Arjuna to see His infinite forms. The Lord had given Arjuna
Divine Vision (which is defectless) with which Arjuna is able to see
the Lord (who is defectless). This is an example of pratyaksha
pramana.
(ii) Verse 7.7: The Lord states mayi sarvam idaṁ protaṁ sūtre
maṇigaṇā iva - Everything in the universe is supported by Me, just
like a garland of pearls is supported by a string. When one sees a
garland of pearls, the string which holds the pearls together is
normally not visible. But one can infer the presence of the string as
the pearls cannot hold themselves together. This is like inferring the
presence of fire on a hill just by watching the smoke from a distance,
as smoke will be visible only when there is fire. This is an example
of anumana pramana.
(iii) Verse 16.24: The Lord states tasmāc chāstraṁ pramāṇaṁ te
kāryākāryavyavasthitau - Therefore, scriptures are your guide in
performing right deeds and avoiding wrong deeds. The Lord states
that shastram (scriptures) are the pramanas (means) to understand
right and wrong deeds. This is an example of agama pramana.

Annexure 3

429

The Lord is knowable through the Vedas
(i) Verse 7.8: The Lord states praṇavaḥ sarvavedeṣu - I am the
primordial syllable Om in the Vedas.
(ii) Verse 15.15: The Lord states vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyo I am the one exclusively described in all Vedas.
(iii)) Verse (15.18): The Lord states atosmi loke vede ca prathitaḥ
puruṣottamaḥ - I am known as the Supreme Being and described as
such in scriptures that are composed (loka) and revealed (the Vedas).
